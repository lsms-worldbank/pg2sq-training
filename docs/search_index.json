About this guide Undoubtedly, fieldwork training is one of the most crucial activities of any survey and significantly influences the quality of the collected data. However, in many surveys, it is not as effective as it could be, leading to suboptimal data quality. This guide provides actionable advice for successfully planning and delivering effective fieldwork training, which prepares field workers to collect high-quality data, without overburdening trainers or overstretching survey resources. This guide is a valuable resource for a diverse range of survey practitioners. Survey designers and funders can benefit from guidance on the resources necessary for successful fieldwork training. Meanwhile, survey and fieldwork managers, as well as trainers, will find practical tools and tips on how to plan, prepare, and implement fieldwork training that is both effective and efficient. Refer to the chapter summaries below to find out which part(s) may be most beneficial to you. This guide is organized into 4 Chapters: Chapter 1 Essentials outlines the main objectives that fieldworker training should aim to accomplish and provides a summary of key recommendations on how to effectively achieve them. If you’re short on time and need a quick overview, this chapter is for you! Chapter 2 Planning and preparation is targeted at anyone involved in the planning and preparation of fieldwork training, from survey funders to survey or fieldwork managers and trainers. It covers important aspects such as training location, timing, size, trainers, content, and schedules, and provides checklists to ensure nothing is missed before the training. Chapter 3 Conducting the training is a valuable resource for trainers looking to conduct effective and efficient fieldwork training. It offers comprehensive details and step-by-step guides for different training modules. It is a highly recommended read for trainers while preparing for and conducting the training. Chapter 4 Assess &amp; select fieldworkers explains how to implement a competitive, skill-based fieldworker selection process that is crucial for achieving high-quality surveys. It is primarily aimed at trainers and offers step-by-step guides on how to effectively implement written tests, systematically evaluate skills, and ultimately select fieldworkers. Survey designers and managers may be interested in reading about the benefits of this approach that are summarized at the beginning of the chapter. The recommendations in this guide should be considered as a helpful resource rather than a prescriptive solution. Although the methodology presented has proven effective in delivering successful fieldwork training, survey practitioners are encouraged to evaluate which improvements can be implemented given the context and constraints of their respective survey. This guide is written with reference to training for an LSMS-style surveys, i.e., in-person training for medium- to large-scale household surveys that cover a range of socioeconomic topics and implemented using CAPI (with specific guidance for Survey Solutions). However, most recommendations can be easily adapted to other survey types, modes, or software packages. This guidebook is the first in a series of Practical Guides to Survey Quality, developed by the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) team. About this series In the world of international development, surveys play a crucial role in informing official statistics, public policy design, and social research. There are flagship and long-standing survey programs such as the LSMS, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) that are widely recognized as methodologically sound and producing high-quality data. However, all too often there are other surveys that adopt suboptimal methods, leading to poor-quality data due to either a lack of capacity or scarcity of resources. Given that surveys are a crucial (and often the only) source of data on socioeconomic indicators available for decision making in the developing world, it is paramount that they are of the highest possible quality. To address this issue, the LSMS team is developing a guidebook series aimed at steering survey practitioners away from bad practices and pointing them towards proven best practices that improve survey quality - even in a resource-constrained environment. The guidebook series will produce guides for all stages of the survey life cycle from inception, design, preparation, fieldwork training, fieldwork to post-fieldwork. Each guide in the series will provide practical and actionable guidance to optimize survey quality, including available knowledge, best practices, and practical tips. The guidebooks draw from other existing guidelines, previous similar efforts, as well as insights from the academic survey methodology literature. Perhaps more importantly, they drawn from the extensive experience of internal and external survey experts in designing and implementing complex large-scale surveys, most notably LSMS surveys that serve as the backbone of welfare and poverty measurement throughout the developing world. Survey methodology is constantly evolving with innovative approaches to data quality assurance continually being identified, particularly with advancement of technology. As such, guides part of this series are published as eBooks online, intended to be a living documents featuring new expansions and revisions on a semi-continuous basis. LSMS guidebooks. This series and other LSMS guidebooks offer information on best practices related to survey design and implementation. While the Guidebooks differ in scope, length, and style, they share a common objective: to provide statistical agencies, researchers, and practitioners with rigorous yet practical guidance on a range of issues related to designing and fielding high-quality household surveys. The series draws on experience accumulated from decades of LSMS survey implementation, the expertise of LSMS staff and other survey experts, and new research using LSMS data and methodological validation studies.

"],["training-essentials.html", "Chapter 1 Essentials 1.1 Objectives 1.2 Key recommendations", " Chapter 1 Essentials 1.1 Objectives For a survey to collect high-quality data, fieldwork training should aim to achieve the following objectives: Build fieldworker capability. In-depth content training, extensive practice, and capability-based selection ensure that fieldworkers are capable of implementing the survey as designed. This is essential to limit measurement error, nonresponse error, as well as coverage and sampling errors, particularly if the survey includes listing and in-field sampling. Standardize fieldworker behavior. Repeated practice under supervision and continuous feedback streamline how fieldworkers implement the survey. Reducing idiosyncratic behavior is critical to mitigate the fieldworker effect, i.e., survey error not being random, but related to specific interviewers, which can have very damaging effects on survey accuracy. Scrutinize methodology. Ideally, this is done during pre-testing and piloting. However, particularly when this has been insufficient, fieldwork training often is effectively the most detailed review of the questionnaires, translations, CAPI, and survey processes. Identifying and correcting mistakes is key to reducing specification error. 1.2 Key recommendations Follow below key recommendations to ensure a successful fieldworker training. Close your laptop and engage. As a survey designer or manager, do not simply leave the delivery of training to the survey firm, fieldwork manager, or trainers. Instead, participate actively in the training process, ensure that the content is correctly understood, explain what matters, and more. You’ve put a lot of effort into designing the survey - make sure it’s implemented correctly. Train an excess of at least 20% of fieldworkers. This allows for meaningful competency-based fieldworker selection at the end of the training and to have a reserve of fieldworkers. If working with unknown teams, mainly new recruits, or expected high attrition, increase the excess to 40% to ensure capable fieldworkers. Assess trainees from the beginning. Use frequent written tests throughout the training to evaluate their understanding of the survey content. Where expert measurements are required, use standardized tests to assess their skills and accuracy. Observe and rate key skills in a structured way. Select fieldworkers based on capacity. Select interviewers, supervisors and other fieldwork roles towards the end of the training, based on capacity demonstrated during the training. Be careful when considering other criteria such as previous survey experience, as this may not be the best indicator of capacity level for the given survey. Don’t cut on duration! Allow at least 15 working days of fieldwork training for an LSMS-style survey with a questionnaire of 2-2.5 hours. Shorter training is normally not enough for the complex content of a socio-economic questionnaire to be learned and sufficiently practiced. Build enough time into the survey schedule for preparation, pre-test and pilot, so you do not have to cut short the training if there are any delays. Keep it small. Try not to train more than 50 people at the same time. Learning outcomes quickly decrease with larger class sizes. If necessary, try to adjust the fieldwork plan such that fewer fieldworkers work over a longer period. Sufficient and experienced trainers. Delivering quality training is more than a full-time job. Make sure there are enough trainers and that they have solid survey, context and subject experience. Sending only a junior colleague without much experience to be in charge of the training is not a good idea. Be prepared. Make sure questionnaires, translations, CAPI and manuals are truly ready prior to the start of training and have been thoroughly tested. Have the venue fully set up and all admin and logistics sorted before starting. The quality of training can suffer badly from insufficient preparation. Less instructional &amp; theoretical, more interactive &amp; hands-on. Avoid one-directional training methods where trainers give long presentations about theory and questionnaires. Instead, engage trainees as much as possible on actual training content. Train using the manual, demonstrations, videos, real-world examples, etc. Practice, practice, practice. Frequent practice is crucial for trainees to fully internalize the content and be able to apply it in the field. Do not leave (field) practice to the end. Practice in groups, front-of-class role-plays and with respondents on-site or in the field throughout the training. Tailored feedback. Throughout the training, don’t limit yourself to general dos and don’ts. Instead, observe trainees during practice and check their tests to understand where they may be going wrong and offer specific feedback to help them improve. Go beyond the questionnaire. Knowing the questionnaires alone does not make good interviewers. Trainees need to learn and practice a set of interviewing techniques such as correct probing or encouraging participation as well as pre- or post-interview tasks, such as respondent selection or responding to rejected interview files in CAPI. Assess readiness for field. At the end of the training, conduct a final field test that mimics field conditions and allows fieldworkers to be observed and evaluated before using the actual sample. If the team is not ready, extend the training by a few days to revisit and strengthen problematic areas.

Fieldwork training should be planned well in advance and must be well prepared. It usually consists of a main interviewer training and separate training for supervisors, data monitors or other fieldworker roles. Survey designers, please take note of the sub-chapters on Training size, Trainers and Timing &amp; duration, as they are budget and timeline relevant. For survey managers and trainers all sub-chapters are relevant to plan and prepare a solid fieldworker training. 2.1 Training size It is strongly recommended to train more trainees than are ultimately needed as fieldworkers, i.e., as interviewers, supervisors, data monitors or other roles. This allows for a competency-based selection of fieldworkers at the end of the training. Training more people than needed also compensates for any attrition during training and builds a reserve of already-trained people that can be brought up to speed and substituted relatively quickly during fieldwork, should the need arise. For a meaningful selection process train at least 20% more fieldworkers than are required if you are working with experienced teams who you have worked with before and if you are expecting few trainees to drop out during the training. For example, train at least 48 people if you are aiming for 40 fieldworkers. Increase the excess to at least 40% if you are working with unknown trainees, a new implementing partner, in a new context or expect a high number of drop-outs during training. Under these conditions, 56 people should be trained to reach 40 fieldworkers. Training a smaller excess of trainees is not recommended as it prohibits a meaningful fieldworker selection process and increases the risk of having to rely on trainees that are not up to the task. Often, some trainees will drop out during training, particularly after day 1 or 2 once there is a clearer understanding of the required effort. Mitigate early trainee attrition by keeping on standby some of the applicants that have not been invited to the training, so they can quickly replace any trainees that have not come back. You might have to bring them up to speed in extra hours and ask them to independently catch up on material already covered. It is not advised to bring in additional trainees after day 3, as they will have fallen too far behind. Real-world example: Towards the end of the fieldwork training for one survey, trainees staged a walkout and collectively refused to continue training or fieldwork unless their (somewhat unrealistic) demands were met. This put survey management in a very difficult position and the survey itself at risk. Demands could not be met and there was no time or budget to repeat the training with other trainees. Avoid walkouts by setting fair fieldworker terms and conditions, making them clear to trainees and getting their written agreement prior to the training. In many circumstances it is beneficial to select supervisors, data monitors and any other fieldwork roles from the pool of trainees based on their performance and capabilities observed during the training (see Assessment &amp; selection). If any of the fieldwork roles are predetermined, the designated persons should participate in the fieldwork training without being counted towards the trainee excess (and required to demonstrate full understanding of the trained material). Keep the overall number of trainees as small as possible, ideally below 50 trainees, which corresponds to at most 36 fieldworkers. Learning outcomes quickly decrease with increasing class size, as each trainee receives less supervision and personal feedback and as it is more difficult for trainers to keep track of trainees’ performance. Tip: Whenever possible, design the fieldwork plan so that fewer interviewers work over a longer period of time, requiring fewer fieldworkers to be trained. Centralized training, i.e. having all trainees in one location at the same time, is the preferred method of training. It guarantees that all trainees hear the same training at the same time. They all hear any questions that may arise, and the explanations to resolve any confusion. However, if having more than 50 trainees is unavoidable (e.g., surveys in large countries or with a large sample) or centralized training is not possible (e.g., different languages or a geographically dispersed sample), it is best or can be imperative to split fieldworker training into separate rooms or even locations. In those instances, it is paramount to standardize the training as much as possible across different rooms/locations to minimize the training effect, i.e., interviewer behavior being correlated to the training rooms/locations, which is very damaging for the accuracy of a survey. This requires training to be guided mainly by standardized and extremely well-prepared training materials, as well as effective communication between the training rooms/locations, so that all trainees benefit from relevant feedback, comments, questions, etc. raised in each room/location. On top of that, there must be sufficient capable trainers who have received a comprehensive Training of Trainers (ToT). The ToT can be a dedicated exercise or integrated as an explicit outcome of the pilot training. Several scenarios are possible if a large number of fieldworkers need to be trained: Break-out sessions. This is the first best option to train class sizes of 50-100 trainees if they can be trained centrally. Split the class into groups of manageable size (around 15-20 trainees each) and assign dedicated trainers to each group. Use the break-out sessions to train everything that is sensitive to class size, including the questionnaire reading and practicing. Trainers must keep notes of any additional clarifications they provided, questions they received or feedback they gave. Hold daily plenary sessions with the entire class in which feedback is given based on the notes from individual sessions. Modules that are less size-sensitive, such as the opening module or fieldwork logistics can be trained in the full class. Parallel training. If joint plenary sessions are unfeasible due to an unavoidably larger class size, the trainees must be split into groups and trained either in parallel or consecutive training. (As noted above, whenever possible try to avoid this by adjusting the fieldwork plan.) For parallel training, groups are trained separately but at the same time and in the same location (i.e., different rooms of the same building). Each group should have a “resident” trainer, who is responsible for its training. Other trainers can rotate among groups, for example those responsible for training a certain module or task, bringing some consistency to the parallel sessions. Because groups and trainers do not overlap, it is harder to harmonize training across groups. It is therefore important that trainers keep good notes and debrief during the breaks and at the end of the day. Consecutive training. Trainees are split into groups which are trained one after the other, possibly in different locations. A core set of trainers repeats the same training for each group, providing consistency across all groups. Since each group of trainees should start fieldwork immediately after their training, this approach only works when it is possible to stagger the start of fieldwork (e.g., if fieldwork is sufficiently long). Additional trainers should attend the training for each group to supervise the field start of one group while the core trainers move on to train the next one. Parallel locations. It is not recommended to simultaneously train in multiple locations, as it is difficult to harmonize fieldwork training between different locations. If unavoidable, it is essential that extra effort is put into preparation of training materials, that trainers keep good notes, and that they frequently communicate and debrief with trainers from other locations. 2.2 Trainers The success of fieldwork training hinges upon having enough and competent trainers. Conducting fieldwork training is a substantial amount of work! Doing it well - even more so. Prepare the training well to avoid significantly reducing quality or overwhelming trainers. Make provisions for enough trainers so they can conduct the training well. For every room, there needs to be a minimum of two active trainers at any point in time: one to lead the training and another to support the class and do any of the supporting activities that happen in parallel, such as updating manuals, compiling feedback, creating practicing scenarios, etc. Larger classes require more trainers because supervision and supporting activities increase. Ideally, there should be one active trainer for every 15-20 trainees. Trainers must be available to actively engage in the training most of the time. Avoid the situation where trainers are physically present on site but are in meetings instead of the training room, focused on tasks unrelated to the survey, or are otherwise disengaged from training. If trainers have ongoing responsibilities outside of the training (which is often the case), plan to have more than two trainers per room. Every trainer must have: A good understanding of the survey in general. A detailed understanding of the questionnaires, definitions, protocols, manual, CAPI, etc. Ideally, they have been involved in the survey design process, participated in the pre-test or pilot and will be involved in managing and monitoring fieldwork. A general understanding of the survey subject, e.g., the regional agricultural systems for an agricultural survey. Good facilitation skills and the ability to lead and manage all components of the training. Collectively, the trainers of each room should also have: A good understanding of the indicators’ construction, the intended data use or analysis. Subject and context expertise, e.g., know in detail the local circumstances of child education, nutrition and health for a survey on early child development. Experience implementing the survey type and implementing surveys in the context. Experience conducting fieldworker training. Fluency in the trainees’ language. Do not train in a language the trainees are not fluent in! If some trainers (usually the survey designers or analysts) do not speak the training language, use an interpreter or ask other trainers to translate for them. In many instances, particularly in surveys with limited pre-testing and piloting, mismatches between survey design and field reality are uncovered during the training and adjustments need to be made quickly. For example, it may become evident that a locally-practiced exchange labor system cannot be accurately captured in the presented questionnaire. Trainers need the above expertise and experience to be able to identify such issues and make decisions that are analytically correct, in-line with the survey design and make sense within the local context. Warning: There is a tendency to send junior analysts or PhD students without sufficient survey or context experience to conduct fieldwork training. This can work, as long as other experienced trainers are present and engaged, but quickly leads to quality issues if they are the main training lead and the others become unavailable/inattentive. Similarly, handing over a sample and questionnaire to a survey firm and letting them implement the training without close oversight or any participation is usually a bad idea. Firms commonly lack the necessary analytical background, are not familiar with the details of the survey design, are differently motivated, and/or might not have the capacity to conduct the training to the required standard. It is recommended to send your own trainer(s) to be present at the training, especially if working with a new firm. They can support as needed and ensure the training meets the quality standards described here. Subject experts are sometimes invited to facilitate training on specific modules. Unfortunately, they often have their own priorities and varying training capacity, resulting in overly complicated or confusing sessions (e.g., long theoretical presentations with details that are largely irrelevant for interviewers). If external subject experts will lead parts of your training, make sure they fully understand the relevant parts of the questionnaire and what content and level of detail are most appropriate for trainees. Prior to the training, discuss the scope of their engagement and review their contributions, such as presentations. Another role for subject experts during fieldwork training can be to help answer any questions on their subject and contribute to relevant discussions. 2.3 Content To equip trainees with all the knowledge and skills necessary to do a successful job as a fieldworker, training must go beyond a simple discussion of the questionnaire and cover the components listed below. See details on how to implement each of them in the next chapter. CAPI use. Interviewers must understand and be able to use all functionality features of the CAPI software that will be used in the field, including navigating through the CAPI questionnaire, creating and sending interview files, etc. it is best to keep theory limited and introduce functionality throughout the training at the time it is relevant, so trainees can practice it immediately. Questionnaire content. All questionnaires must be covered in detail, including question text, answer types and options, how to administer questions and sections, the question routing (skip instructions or enabling rules), and the underlying definitions and concepts. Interview practice. Repeated practicing – in groups, with respondents, on-site and in the field – is crucial for trainees to fully internalize the trained material, to learn how to put it into practice and to have exposure to real respondents and scenarios during the training. Interview techniques. Trainees must learn and practice a range of skills that are critical to collecting good data, such as how to introduce yourself and the survey, convincing respondents to participate; how to probe and inquire for clarifications without introducing bias, and how to control the interview (i.e., keep respondents focused on the interview). Expert measurements. Many surveys include exercises such as anthropometrics, plot measurement or capacity testing, which require interviewers to use specialist equipment and strictly adhere to measurement procedures to ensure comparable measurements. Trainees must practice until they can correctly implement the exercise and behavior across the entire field team is standardized. Pre-interview tasks. Interviewers need to learn the format in which they will receive their assigned units (e.g., households), any selection protocols they might have to follow, how to locate and confirm the identity of units, when to revisit, replacement protocols, how to manage their workload, etc. Post-interview tasks. It is important that interviewers know how to correctly perform a range of activities after an interview, including checking the files for completion, addressing inconsistencies, leaving comments, submitting files, receiving and responding to feedback on submitted interviews, making corrections to the files, etc. Final field test. At the end of the training, a final field test should be conducted to identify and address any outstanding issues with questionnaires or field procedures, expose interviewers to real field conditions and determine if they are ready for field work. Supervisor training: Supervisors must learn how to manage field teams and the relationship to the communities and respondents. They must also understand the tasks they are responsible for in the survey, such as handling money, making logistical arrangements, checking completions, communicating with survey management or data monitors, etc. Data monitor training: Data monitors need to learn all the tools and background information necessary to be effective in their roles, including how to review interviews, conduct re-interviews, review audio recordings, interpret summarized information, provide effective feedback to fieldworkers, and compile feedback for survey management and archiving. 2.4 Timing &amp; duration Fieldwork training should be held just prior to the start of fieldwork, with a maximum of 1-3 days between training and fieldwork to allow for administrative matters, a rest day and travel to the field. An immediate fieldwork start with strong supervision and feedback in the first few days is the best way to ensure the survey is being implemented as trained and that fieldworker behavior is streamlined. The longer the break, the higher the risk of interviewers forgetting details, making mistakes and developing idiosyncratic behavior. If fieldwork is delayed by more than a few days, conduct a short refresher training just prior to the field start to revisit and practice key points of the trained material. For longer delays, a longer refresher training will be necessary. For breaks beyond a few weeks, often complete retraining is the only solution, in part due to the likelihood of having many new trainees. Schedule enough time for fieldwork training. The optimal duration depends on a range of factors, including the nature of the questionnaire, tasks required by fieldworkers, experience level of trainees, etc. As a general rule of thumb, for a multi-topic, socio-economic survey with a questionnaire of 2-2.5 hours, allow around 15 working days (2.5 weeks) for the main interviewer training, including practicing and final field test. Training duration can vary with survey factors, but keep in mind that many components such as opening session, CAPI use, interviewing skills, and final field test need be trained independently, so even for a survey with a relatively short (45-minutes) questionnaire, at least 6 working days (1 week) of interviewing training should be scheduled. Surveys with longer questionnaires or specialized tasks may require longer fieldworker training. To some readers, this might sound excessively long. Many survey firms, especially those with a background in opinion surveys, will suggest much shorter training durations. However, in socioeconomic surveys, due to the substantial amount and variety of content that fieldworkers need to learn, it is usually impossible to train field teams to an acceptable level in a shorter amount of time. Do not cut the training short, unless you are very confident that all trainees will have fully internalized all material and will be able to perform well as field workers! Tip: Be prepared for possible extensions. In many surveys, trainees are not ready to go to the field at the end of the training and the training needs to be extended for a few days. If extensions have not been budgeted for, this can cause quality issues, e.g., the survey firm having to cut corners elsewhere to compensate for unanticipated training costs. Avoid this by setting out with a realistic training schedule and putting contingencies for potential extensions into the budget and timelines. Avoid fieldworker training that lasts longer than 3 weeks (18 working days). Trainees’ ability to absorb and remember material and general morale decrease with training length. Also, since every day of fieldworker training is quite expensive, it leads to paying for days that are increasingly ineffective while reducing the funds available for other survey activities. Conducting an efficient and yet effective training as described in Chapter 3 Conducting the training should allow most surveys to be trained well in less than 3 weeks. For surveys with a large number of questionnaires (e.g., school surveys) or special tasks such as anthropometrics or plot measurements that take a substantial amount of time to train (e.g., solid anthropometrics training can take 4-6 days), often it is unrealistic for interviewers to learn all questionnaires and tasks sufficiently well in the time available. Instead, divide questionnaires and tasks between specialized fieldworker roles. For example, anthropometrics could be collected by dedicated measurers and the main interviews are conducted by interviewers. This way, each fieldworker role can focus on their questionnaires/tasks and learn how to implement them well. Furthermore, different fieldworker roles can be trained in separate training sessions, which cuts overall training length and costs. Supervisor training should be held outside of the main interviewer training hours, so that supervisor candidates can attend the interviewer training in full. If supervisors are designated prior to training, supervisor training can be held just prior to the main training for a couple of days. If supervisors are selected during the training, it can be held towards the end of the training, either after interviewer training has ended for the day or during the day when modules that are not relevant for supervisors are being covered (e.g., administrative days, review sessions of material they have already mastered, etc.). The duration depends on the scope of the tasks, but generally 2-3 days are sufficient. Data monitor training is best held after the final field test so that the data collected in the field test can be used as training and practicing material. Data monitors should attend interviewer training and field testing to have a good understanding of the data collection activities they will be responsible for monitoring during fieldwork. Availability of trainers permitting, it can be held in parallel to the supervisor training, between training and field work, and/or during the first few days of field work. Generally, 2-3 days are sufficient for initial training and practicing with an additional 2-3 days of supervised work during the first days of field work. 2.5 Schedule Prepare a realistic training schedule and track training progress on an on-going basis. Keep in mind the following general considerations to plan an effective and efficient fieldwork training: Stay flexible. Create a schedule that identifies all modules and allocates the required time. Use the schedule to track progress, ensure you are not falling behind and to plan your logistics, e.g., on what days you will need the training venue or transport. Expect timings to shift a little during the training, as some topics/activities tend to take longer or shorter than anticipated. Do not force compliance with the original schedule; instead adjust the training schedule to the updated requirements of the training. Stay flexible to allow sufficient time to address issues, retrain topics, or dive into more detail as needed. Allocate time generously. It is better to finish training early one day rather than keeping trainees until late, rushing content or having trainees that are not ready for the field at the end. If training starts falling behind schedule, make a decision to extend training as early as possible – before logistical arrangements make it impossible. If training progresses faster than anticipated, use the extra time for additional practicing. Only shorten the training if you are certain that the trainees are fully ready for the field. Practice frequently. Do not leave (field) practice to the end of training. Schedule daily group practices and front-of-class interviews towards the beginning of training to solidify newly learned material. Practice with respondents on-site or in the field during the latter half of the training to prepare trainees for fieldwork. Factor in time for written tests and debriefs. From the start of training, conduct regular written tests on days that new material is covered and then review tests and results with the class afterwards. Doing the test reviews the following day also simultaneously serves as a great recap of the material learned the previous day. Frequently change training modality. This keeps trainees engaged and thus able to better absorb and retain content. For example, break long blocks of content training with group practices or role play activities for learning interviewing techniques. Rotate trainers between different questionnaire modules to spice up the training and keep up attention levels. It is tiring for trainees to always hear the same voice and for trainers to lead a full day of training. Schedule time to debrief after field days. Avoid back-to-back field practice or testing days, which may allow trainees to form idiosyncratic, potentially undesired behaviors. After a field practice or field test, allow for enough time to debrief, provide feedback and retrain topics that have not gone well, so trainees can try to do better on them during the next field day. Typically, one day of in-class training is needed between field days. Train what is relevant. Only train content that interviewers need to know. Allocate time on topics proportionate to their direct importance for the interviewers. For example, spend less time on the general background of the survey and more on how to introduce it properly to respondents; or spend less time on explaining how an indicator is calculated and more time on how to properly collect the data needed for the indicator. Train material just before it can be practiced. Otherwise, trainees often forget the content, requiring it to be retrained. For example, it can be ineffective to train in detail the cover section of a questionnaire (identifiers, visit outcome, etc.) at the beginning of the training, as trainees do not yet know the protocols, questionnaire, respondents, etc. nor are familiar with CAPI yet. Instead, train the cover section details just before interviewers will use them for the first time, (e.g., before the first field practice) and once they have a better overview over questionnaire, respondents and protocols. Split long questionnaires. First train and extensively practice (on-site and in field) one part before moving on to another part (e.g., household questionnaire and then agricultural questionnaire, or household level sections and then individual level sections). Breaking the content into more manageable sizes makes it easier for trainees to solidify learned material. Schedule around low energy periods. Schedule theory and important content in the mornings when trainees are usually freshest. Trainee attention tends to decrease in the afternoon and is at its lowest after coming back from the field or directly after having a heavy lunch. Directly after lunch, schedule hands-on and interactive modules that require greater engagement from trainees, such as practicing, interviewing techniques or written tests. Avoid training after coming back from the field. Train supervisors and data monitors outside of main training hours. They need to attend the main fieldworker training in full to understand field procedures. Time slot options typically include prior to the main training, if roles are predetermined, or towards the end of the training once roles have been selected. This can be during the late afternoon or on the trainee’s administrative, travel or rest days. Do not exceed 6-7 hours of training time per day and give frequent breaks, without the breaks being too long and taking over the day. For example, this could be a morning session from 9:00 - 13:00h, and an afternoon session from 14:00 - 17:00h, each with a flexible 15-minute break between modules. Close the main training early enough to allow for supervisor training (when needed), daily trainer debriefs and preparing for the next day. Rest days. If training lasts more than one week, make sure to schedule one or two rest days per week. Trainees and trainers need regular breaks for good learning outcomes. The training schedule in Figure 2.1 illustrates how fieldwork training can be organized for a survey with a 2-2.5 hours interview and a questionnaire in two parts. Each day lists the training modules to be covered and the total estimated number of hours to be spent on each one. Note that many modules should be split into individual sessions and mixed as will be illustrated further below. More details on what to consider and how to deliver each module are given in the corresponding part of Chapter 3 Conducting the training. Figure 2.1: An illustrative training schedule Tool: Click here to download an Excel version of the illustrative schedule. For an actual training schedule more details usually need to be included, such as a breakdown of the questionnaire sections or topics to be covered in each module and the trainers and the location for each. Table 2.2 below shows what a detailed schedule may look like for day 2, 3, 8 or 9 of the training outlined above. Table 2.1: Table 2.2: Example of detailed schedule for one training day Time Module Trainer Location 09.00 - 09.45 Review written test &amp; recap Trainer A Classroom 09.45 - 11.00 Questionnaire content: Labor Trainer B Classroom 11.00 - 11.15 Tea break 11.15 - 12.00 Group practice: Labor Garden 12.00 - 13.00 Questionnaire content: Health Trainer A Classroom 13.00 - 14.00 Lunch break 14.00 - 14.45 Group practice: Labor &amp; Health Garden 14.45 - 15.30 Questionnaire content: Education Trainer B Classroom 15.30 - 15.45 Tea break 15.45 - 16.30 Front-of-class interview: all sections Trainer A Classroom 16.30 - 17.00 Written test Classroom Note that on this schedule questionnaire content sessions are no more than 1.25 hours long and are followed by practicing sessions so trainees can familiarize themselves with the newly covered material. Trainers and training modality change frequently and trainees get to change venue. More material is being introduced in the morning when trainees are freshest and more practicing is in the afternoon when energy levels are lower. Active training time is 6.5 hours and there are regular breaks. For well-established surveys, in which time requirements are better known, a structured training schedule is feasible and recommended. Having a more general and flexible schedule would be useful and more efficient for surveys that are wholly new or even just new to the survey team. In this case, the schedule can be more easily adjusted during the training to reflect both progress and deficiencies without the burden of updating and redistributing a detailed schedule every time there is a small change. Prior to the start of training prepare a rough schedule for the entire training to identify which resources are required on what day. During training, define detailed daily schedules for only the next 1-2 days of training. 2.6 Location Fieldwork training is best held in a location that: Has sufficient logistical capacity: Is easy to reach for trainers and trainees, has a suitable training venue (see more on this below), sufficient accommodation and dining/eating options for your group size, good network coverage, print shops, etc. Facilitates field testing: Is close to communities that are similar to, but outside of, the sample. If the survey is limited to a specific region or area, it is best to conduct the fieldwork training there. Facilitates field start: Allows field teams to start field work shortly after the training and trainers to supervise the first few days of field work. Find a training venue with a hall large enough to comfortably fit the entire team (or multiple halls if parallel sessions are held) and space to breakout into smaller teams for group exercises, such as a garden, hallways, the canteen or additional rooms. It is crucial that there is good internet connectivity at the venue, either through on-site Wi-Fi, or general network connectivity. The venue should be either able to accommodate trainees and cater their food, or be easily accessible and close to restaurants or eateries. It should be quiet and free from distractions. Good venues tend to be hotels or conference centers with garden or open space. Avoid universities, schools, towns halls or other places that are busy and become easily unavailable. Tip: Book the venue early and check availability options in case the training needs to be extended on short notice. 2.7 Preparation Avoid wasting precious training time by preparing in advance as much of the materials as possible. Prior to starting fieldwork training, the following should be in place: Trainees informed of survey details and terms. To minimize attrition of trainees, make sure that trainees have been informed of and agreed in advance to the overall survey parameters and contract terms. This includes the selection process, their remuneration package, insurance coverage, areas to be visited, the length of field work, the transport and lodging arrangements during field work, expected effort, etc. Often, trainees drop out of the training if their expectations were wrong. Have trainees sign a copy of the details prior to the training to indicate their understanding of the terms. Contractual matters. All contracts, payment arrangements, insurance policies and other administrative matters should be prepared such that they do not delay training or fieldwork. It is also important that trainees are paid without delays and are covered by insurance. Avoid interrupting the training with contractual matters, e.g., pulling out individual trainees to sign contracts. Instead, schedule dedicated admin slots prior to training, after class or between training and fieldwork. After fieldworker selection at the end of the training, make sure there is time to address all contractual matters (including insurance and payments) in the (usually short) window between training and the start of fieldwork. Logistical/administrative support. Ensure there is a dedicated person to support all logistical and administrative work that has to be done during the training, e.g., setting up the venue, organizing transport, contacting local leaders, printing, purchasing equipment, signing fieldworker contracts, etc. If these activities have to be done by the trainers, they become a substantial distraction and can significantly affect training quality and pace. Projector with a BIG screen. The projected content must be visible and legible to all trainees. You should be able to connect a PC and as well as a CAPI tablet/phone to the projector. Ideally, it should be possible to quickly link trainees’ devices to the projector, to facilitate exercises and practicing. Test the set-up prior to the first day of training. Stable internet connection for all devices. Trainees need to sync the devices used for CAPI data collection several times per day. Usually, the Wi-Fi connection of a training venue is not sufficient to connect all devices at the same time. In such cases, additional mobile network routers or wifi hot-spots are required. One option is to provide during the training the internet connection that is planned to support fieldwork, e.g., dongles, mobile phone routers or SIM cards. Food and refreshments for the breaks. If food is provided by the venue, make sure it is ready in time for the scheduled breaks. If trainees eat out for lunch, set reasonable break times that allow trainees to finish lunch and to be back on time. Incentivize punctuality (e.g., those coming back late from the break have to sing a song). One tablet/phone per trainee. It is crucial for all trainees to learn how to navigate the questionnaire in CAPI and how to use the device. If you do not have enough devices (since there are more trainees than interviewers) borrow additional devices for the training period. Devices must meet the minimum specifications for the CAPI software (see here for Survey Solutions) and have the correct CAPI version installed. Consider using an app blocker so that only pertinent apps are available to users. Stress that the device is solely for the survey and not for other uses. Add shortcut/icons on the main screen for CAPI, the softcopy of the manual, the calculator or any other relevant app. Fully set-up CAPI software. This can include installing the CAPI software on a server, creating interviewer accounts for each trainee, importing questionnaires to the server and syncing questionnaires/assignments to individual tablets – whatever steps are needed to ensure that tablets are ready for trainees to use. If the questionnaire includes substantial pre-loading (e.g., household rosters in a panel survey), you can also create several assignments partially pre-filled with different scenarios. Device charging. Avoid delays due to charging issues. Provide (plenty of) extension cords to charge tablets during the training and/or in the evenings. Provide power banks for field days if the device charge does not last a full day. Samples of documents. If fieldworkers need to interpret, verify or extract information from any documents or items such as immunization cards, school timetables, or anti-malaria medications, get enough copies/samples to allow for hands-on practicing. If there is variation, provide different examples, e.g., different antimalarial medication brands. Measurement equipment. If fieldworkers need to use any special measurement equipment –height/length boards, GPS units, water testing kits, student testing booklets, etc. – provide enough units so that trainees can practice in a meaningful way. Field procedure documents. Ensure sufficient copies of any additional documents (beyond the questionnaire and manuals) that fieldworkers need to use in the field – introduction letters, household tracking lists, maps, cluster completion sheets, referral forms, etc. Finalized questionnaires. The questionnaires should already be reviewed, extensively pre-tested or piloted, translated and the translations verified. The CAPI version of the questionnaire should be extensively desk-tested and error free. Mistakes can cause significant issues or delays during the training. For surveys that will be implemented using paper questionnaires, make sure that there are copies of the paper questionnaire available for each trainee to have his/her own copy. For surveys that will be implemented using CAPI, while it can sometimes be useful to have paper copies of the questionnaire for the trainees, try to avoid this as the trainees need to be able to follow the flow as defined by the CAPI program. Fieldworker manuals. Realistically, fieldworker manuals tend not to be used during fieldwork. Their primary value lies as a reference during training and later, for data users, to help them interpret questions and concepts. The content of manuals should mirror the actual training and how fieldworkers interpret questions and concepts. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. For manuals to be useful, good drafts for interviewer, supervisor, and any other fieldworker roles should be available to trainees from the start of training. Modifications and additions to the manuals should be made during training. Manuals should be constantly referred to throughout the training so that trainees develop the habit of consulting them as a knowledge base. It is beneficial to hand out printed versions of the manual at the beginning (as drafts) and at the end (as revised copies), or to provide regularly updated soft copies in PDF format, which trainees can access on their devices—a method that tends to work very well. Tool: The R application Survey Solutions Questionnaire Manual Generator is a useful tool to generate questionnaire manuals in Word, PowerPoint or Html format from a Survey Solutions questionnaire. Draft written tests. Prepare questions for the written tests (link) that cover all concepts and questions in the questionnaire. Test the question with the survey designer. This usually helps to uncover outstanding gaps in the design and ensures the test questions are functioning (unambiguous, understandable, etc.) and the marking is correct. Having questions prepared will allow you to quickly produce daily tests tailored to the day’s progress. Without prior preparation, creating daily tests can be challenging. Find out more on written tests. Confirmed in-field practice. Select practice areas/communities well in advance. These must be locations that are not included in the sample. Make all necessary administrative arrangements such as getting permissions, introduction to village officials, etc. If necessary, arrange respondents for field practices so trainees can spend more time practicing than looking for respondents to participate (don’t do this for the final field test). If you require certain types of respondents (e.g., children for anthropometrics) check with institutions where they are concentrated, e.g., child clinics, schools, etc. Organize reliable transport for the trainees to travel to the field practice. Make sure the transport waits for the team, not the other way round. Confirmed on-site practice. Arrange respondents who will be used for on-site practicing sessions to visit the training venue. Arrange for their transport and remuneration and don’t forget to also provide food/refreshment for them. Facilitation material. This includes microphones and speakers (with batteries and fully tested), flip charts with markers in multiple colors for drawing, name tags/stickers for all participants, printed attendance lists and feedback forms, notebooks, pens in 2 colors, and clipboards for trainees, etc. It tends to be useful to have a printer or printing facilities in or very near the venue to allow ad-hoc printing of exercises, tests, etc. Field work logistics and material. All necessary logistics need to be in place to allow fieldwork to commence immediately after training. This includes fieldworker contracts ready to be signed upon selection, covering insurance policies, payment arrangements, transport, accommodation, etc. Similarly, have all fieldwork equipment ready, such as ID cards, letters of introduction (if needed), back packs, stationary (pens, pencils, paper, etc.), raincoats/boots, battery packs, t-shirts, respondent incentives, etc. "],["conducting-the-training.html", "Chapter 3 Conducting the training 3.1 General considerations 3.2 Welcome/introduction 3.3 CAPI use 3.4 Questionnaire content 3.5 Interview practice 3.6 Interview techniques 3.7 Expert measurements 3.8 Pre-interview tasks 3.9 Post-interview tasks 3.10 Final field test (often called pilot) 3.11 Supervisor training 3.12 Data monitor training", " Chapter 3 Conducting the training This chapter targets trainers, providing details on how to deliver effective and efficient interviewer training that facilitates learning without overstretching survey resources. The chapter assumes in-person training as is the case for most surveys conducted with in-person interviews. The first sub-chapter covers general considerations for the training. The remainder of the chapters is organized by training module. Each sub-chapter provides details on the rational, optimal timing and recommendations for the implementation of the respective module. See the training schedule in Chapter 2 on how individual modules relate and are best combined. Prior to the start of fieldwork training, make sure everything is fully set up. 3.1 General considerations Throughout the fieldwork training, consider the following points: Essentials only. Only train fieldworkers on things that are relevant for them and that their respective role requires them to do. For example, there is no need for interviewers to learn details about the survey analysis or the supervisor role/functionality in the CAPI software. Confirm with designers/analysts. If trainers are uncertain in the interpretation of concepts, questions, or responses, it is important that they keep notes to run these by designers/analysts on a daily basis. Ask them to be on standby so you receive timely responses. Provide updates and clarifications to the trainees in a timely manner. Eliminate language barriers. Do not train in a language the trainees are not fluent in. If some trainers (usually the survey designers or analysts) do not speak the training language, use an interpreter or ask other trainers (e.g., fieldwork manager) to translate or reiterate their points in the training language. Support trainees. Especially during the first few days, trainees often get lost in the CAPI application or questionnaire flow and are unable to follow the sessions. Trainers who are not actively leading a session should walk around the class, check that trainees are in the right place and support those falling behind. Probe for understanding. It is wrong to assume things have been understood just because no one speaks up when you ask, “Any questions?” Trainees may be reluctant to ask any questions, especially if they are used to an education system in which instructors speak without participation and students are simply supposed to listen. Ask questions on specific questionnaire details using common examples or scenarios. Ask variations of your test questions. For example, think of working profiles/jobs that are typical in the surveyed population and probe trainees if these are wage employed or self-employed. Encourage questions. From the beginning, make it clear to trainees that they should ask if they have ANY question, that it is better to ask than to remain with a doubt, and that there are no bad questions. Take questions seriously and address them. If trainees prefer not to ask in front of the class, they can raise their hand and be visited by a trainer. Involve trainees. Ask frequent questions. Let trainees read aloud questions and manuals. Ask them to correct one another. Avoid always picking the most engaged trainees and try to involve everyone. Select a trainee using a random name picker, so it can be anybody’s turn to answer your questions at any moment (and to make the selection process fun). Another idea is to select the person closest to where a paper ball lands that you or anyone throws over their back. To speed things along, let each trainee you call on cover a couple of survey questions. Get to know trainees. Ask trainees to wear name tags during the first few days. Learn their names as quickly as possible. This makes the training more personal and helps trainers to better connect trainees’ in-class performance with written tests or test interviews. Collect and react to feedback. At the end of each day, use feedback forms to collect anonymous feedback from trainees on how clear different sessions or trainers were, topics they did not understand or questions they have. Review feedback forms prior to the next day and adjust your training schedule or methods if needed. Break up and mix groups. If you start noticing groups of trainees sitting together who are not paying attention or are at the bottom end of performance, distribute them across the classroom. Ask low performers to sit next to high performers, so they can help when falling behind. Avoid grouping the same people for exercises, to ensure that everyone has the same understanding of the material. Friends tend to sit together in the training. Assign a number to each person in a row – 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. - group the 1’s together, the 2’s together, etc. - and move the trainees around every day. Use your time effectively. Avoid spending disproportionate amounts of time on rare scenarios. This is counterproductive and takes away time from more frequent and important cases that should be covered. Often, trainees love identifying and pointing out hypothetical issues, e.g., “But what if ….?” If these scenarios are common occurrences, they are worth reviewing during training and may merit updating the questionnaire or manual. If not, instruct trainees to leave comments and alert their supervisors if the situation arises in the field and move on with the training. Make it fun! Maintain a general positive and fun attitude. Play fun and exciting group games. The last person entering the venue late and unexcused can sing a song in front of the class (YouTube is full of Karaoke videos). Hold an end of training party. Use video &amp; audio. It can be a good way of demonstrating certain things like interviewing techniques or special tasks to trainees, so they can see/hear what they should and should not do and learn from examples. Use existing material if it is good, or collect video/audio material during pre-test, pilots and field practices to demonstrate good and bad practices to the class. Stress the importance of their work. Repeatedly make it clear to the trainees that it is important that they do a good job, that the survey result, and ultimately policy decisions, depend on it. Give them a sense of purpose. Like any other human being, interviewers perform better at work if they care about what they do. Trainees are responsible for their learning. Make clear to trainees that it is up to them to ensure they have understood the covered material. They can read the manual, practice outside the class, learn from peers, ask questions, etc. to make sure they understand everything. Let them know there is a transparent and objective selection process at the end and they must pass it to become a fieldworker. Set and enforce rules. Trainees must attend and sign attendance every day. Ask trainees to be on time and respect training hours yourself by not running late or running over time. No side conversations, no (excessive) use of cell phones and no phone conversations in the training room. Enforce rules in a fun but serious way, e.g., anyone breaking rules can donate to a cookie jar, has to hand in their cell phone, sing a song, etc. Zero tolerance for cheating. Make it clear from the beginning that there will be serious consequences for anybody being caught intentionally making up data or purposefully breaking protocols (ideally being immediately dismissed). Also make clear that fieldworkers have nothing to fear as long as they follow what has been taught during training and check with supervisors or fieldwork managers if they are unsure about anything. Daily trainer meeting. Trainers should meet daily at the end of the day to compare notes, evaluate progress and trainee performance, review tests and class feedback and adjust as needed the plan for the following day(s). If field supervisors are pre-determined, include them in the meetings. Document. Throughout the training, note down any changes to the methodology, known problems and general training details, so the details are available for data documentation and to inform future training or survey rounds. Tools: Ideas for group games Sample training feedback form Random name picker to select trainees 3.2 Welcome/introduction The welcome/introduction session serves to introduce trainees to the survey and training. In many surveys, this is unnecessarily long and involves too many people. Keep it as short as possible (1-2 hours are enough) so that some content can still be covered on the morning of the first day. In the welcome/introduction session cover: Opening speeches. Try to keep speeches by officials or leaders as short as politically possible. Also, if possible, avoid making the opening/start of the training dependent on the arrival of guest speakers and government officials, as they might be late (e.g., start with introductions in the meantime). Introduction to survey/organization. Give a brief introduction of the survey, its objectives, the organizations involved, the project/study, the different roles and responsibilities, etc. Do not go into too much detail here, limiting it to what is essential for fieldworkers to know. If needed, provide more details in the manual and refer trainees to it. Introduction of trainers and trainees. All trainers and core survey team should briefly introduce themselves and their roles. If the class size is large, avoid introduction rounds for trainees as they tend to be dull and ineffective. Play a fun ice breaker instead. Ask all trainees and trainers to write their name on a name tag and wear it during the training. Training plan. Give an overview of the rough training schedule and daily working hours. Explain the need for punctuality, that there will be frequent tests and evaluation of skills, that trainees are responsible for their learning, that all questions are encouraged, and that there is zero tolerance for cheating. Point out that the rules and procedures for this survey may be different than in other surveys they might have worked on and that trainees are expected to learn and follow the procedures and rules covered in this training (and not those of other surveys). Survey details and terms. Run through the overall survey parameters and contract terms, including the selection process, their remuneration package, insurance coverage, areas to be visited, the expected length of field work, the transport and lodging arrangements during field work, expected effort, etc. Importantly, this should be a refresher and not the first time trainees learn details about their pay, other terms or the fieldwork. Make sure all trainees have understood and signed a copy of the general terms prior to the training. Administrative/contractual matters. If you need to address administrative or contractual matters with trainees – contract signing, registering for insurance, signing out tablets, etc. – try to do this as much as possible before regular training sessions (e.g., from 8-10 AM), or in another dedicated slot. Trainers do not need to be present. 3.3 CAPI use This chapter is based on using Survey Solutions, but the same principles apply to other CAPI software packages. CAPI, like any other software, is best learned by using it. Covering all functionality in a long theoretical session tends to be very ineffective as any functionality that is not immediately put into practice by trainees is forgotten and needs to be retrained later when it is used. It is more productive – and a better use of time – to start by covering only the basic functionality necessary to begin training, and to gradually introduce additional functionality as required throughout the training. For example, trainees do not need to learn procedures for rejected interviews until they learn about post-interview activities in the latter part of training. Limit the functionality you train to what is relevant for an interviewer and what will be used in the actual survey. For example, trainees do not need to learn how the Supervisor interface works, what exactly happens at HQ, how assignments are processed or what a multi-select question type is if there are none in the questionnaire. The fewer slides you have in the CAPI training, and the more demo and practice you do, the better it will be. Train functionality by demonstrating it on the big screen and asking trainees to follow on their own devices. Make sure the class can follow and wait for anyone falling behind to catch up. If someone is lost, they should check with their neighbors or raise their hand, so one of the trainers can come to assist. For example, show on the big screen how to log in to the Interviewer App. Wait until all trainees are logged in on their tablets. Then, show on the big screen where to find an assignment card, explain what it is and show how to create a file. Wait for everyone to open an interview file on their tablet, and so on. Clarify any questions or doubts trainees might have along the way. You can train the questionnaire directly in CAPI, without training it on paper first, if you are using Survey Solutions or another CAPI software that provides a good overview of the questionnaire, makes routing behavior clearly understandable and allows for free navigation between different parts of the questionnaire. This is usually not the case for software that shows only one question per screen. Training the questionnaire directly in CAPI has the advantages of requiring trainees to only learn the questionnaire in the format they will ultimately use in the field (e.g., no need to learn how skips work on paper). This also means CAPI will be introduced earlier in training and be used more frequently throughout, allowing trainees to more quickly become confident in using the CAPI questionnaire and the CAPI software in general. New trainees do not notice any difference, and experienced trainees who are used to paper questionnaires usually stop missing them after a day or two. Train the basic CAPI functionality just before trainees use it for the first time. Usually, around 1 hour is enough. If you are training the questionnaire on paper, train the CAPI basics just before trainees practice for the first time on the tablets, usually on the first or second day. If you are training the questionnaire directly on CAPI, introduce CAPI basics just before starting with the questionnaire content, usually on the morning of the first day. In these sessions, it is very useful to have trainers roaming through the classroom to look for trainees who may be having problems following the session or who may have a problem with the device. For Survey Solutions, this would mean covering the following topics in the initial CAPI session. Similar steps should be covered for other CAPI software packages. A general overview, including how the Interviewer App and HQ server interact, what assignments and interview files are, and what synchronizing does. Keep this part short. How to log in to the Interviewer App. and how to create an interview file from their assignment. (Trainers should confirm with design and IT teams that tablets and user accounts have been set up prior to the beginning of training). A general overview of the Interviewer App, questionnaire layout, and how to navigate through the questionnaire. The layout of a question – the question number, the question text (what to read to the respondent and what not), the instructions, and the answer options (different by type). Question and section enablement for the first questionnaire section. Other examples can be presented and explained when training covers those sections. The complete screen - marking an interview as complete. The dashboard screen/view for Started and Completed interviews, including reopening an interview file and discarding an interview file. Having completed the above steps, trainees should be able to follow in the questionnaire during the questionnaire content modules. The remaining CAPI functionalities are best trained throughout the training when they are used for the first time: During the questionnaire content modules, train the different question types, roster forms, static texts, sections and sub-sections as they come up. For example, explain fill-in lists during the household member module, yes/no filter questions during assets, etc. Trainees need to recognize and understand the difference between single select, multi-select, numeric, fill-in list and date questions, and understand how rosters function. If using Survey Solutions, prior to practicing or the first written tests, train how to synchronize devices to receive assignments; how to create new interview files and review interviews on the complete screen; marking interviews as complete and synchronizing to send a file. Conducting these written tests on CAPI tends to be useful, as trainees need to correctly synchronize to get the questionnaire/assignment and submit their test (send the completed interview file). Prior to group or field practice, train how to insert comments on questions during the interview and on the Complete Screen, so that trainees can flag their problems or concerns directly in the interview files during practice. After field practice or the final field test, train how to receive rejected interviews, respond to comments, and resubmit rejected interviews. This will allow trainees to practice post-interview tasks using interview files they have created themselves. 3.4 Questionnaire content Trainees must understand the entire questionnaire(s) in detail, including underlying definitions and concepts. If training is dry and monotonic, trainees will lose focus and not retain this substantial amount of content. This is not only an ineffective use of training time but also puts survey quality at risk. Warning: A single, joint reading of a questionnaire is not sufficient for trainees to learn and understand the various concepts, definitions, and scenarios that are necessary to correctly administer a socio-economic questionnaire. Some implementing agencies (e.g., survey firms accustomed to implementing opinion surveys) might not recognize the effort required for complex socio-economic questionnaires and will vastly under-allocate training time for questionnaire content. Consider the following points to make the questionnaire content modules interesting and effective: Avoid content sessions longer than 2 hours. They tend to be information overload for trainees and make it impossible for them to internalize the content. Spread the content training over multiple days and practice newly-trained material on the same day it is presented. Less instructional, more interactive. Avoid one-directional training methods in which trainers give long presentations or read through questionnaires without really interacting with trainees. This tends to be a very ineffective way of teaching questionnaire content. Instead, involve the trainees as much as possible. For each question (or a few at a time), select one trainee to read aloud the question(s) and any instructions, answer options or corresponding manual entry. Ask the trainee to explain in their own words what they have understood and how the question is to be administered. Make sure the rest of the class can hear them. Correct them if needed. Ask the rest of the class for input. Check if the trainee has understood by probing with an example. Give feedback on the tone of voice used to ask the question and the way the trainee asked the question. Ask the trainee to read out the question again if needed. Explain the big picture. At the beginning of each section (or part of the questionnaire if you have small sections), provide a brief general overview to the class, including overall structure and routing behavior, things to be aware of, key concepts and definitions, target respondent(s), etc. It is better to explain these details section by section (rather than once at the beginning of the training for the entire questionnaire) so trainees can immediately see and, soon after, practice what has been trained and can thus remember it more easily. Go into detail where useful. While it is important that all questions are covered during training, some are more complex than others. For these, correct administration and common problems must be covered in greater depth for interviewers to be able to administer them correctly. This can include explanations on the underlying concepts and definitions, how to categorize responses into the pre-defined answer options, common scenarios that require further probing, what error messages mean, under what conditions the question is asked (what enables it), how the question relates to other questions, how to check that responses make sense, etc. These details are not needed for questions that are straightforward and unambiguous. Make it practical and concrete. Definitions for survey concepts such as household, parcel, etc. can be very theoretical and hard for trainees to translate into the real world. When training anything theoretical or abstract, always try to illustrate it with examples and scenarios that are common in the surveyed population so that it is easier for trainees to understand. For example, to explain what wage-employed and self-employed are, list jobs or work profiles that are common and show which category they fall into. Mini quizzes. Conduct short quizzes to test understanding, engage trainees and stimulate discussion. Show a few scenarios, images or videos and ask trainees to record their answer(s) on paper. Afterwards, call on individual trainees to share their answer(s) and explain their rationale. Provide feedback and discuss with the class. This is very effective training for questions that require interviewer interpretation (e.g., confirming household members or parcels to be listed) or understanding a variety of classifications (e.g., differentiating toilet type, wall materials, etc.), and helps to streamline interviewer behavior. Use the manual. The interviewer manual should provide all necessary instruction for correctly administering the questionnaire. The training is the most important opportunity for field staff to learn and understand the critical details provided in the manual and thus its study should be an integral part of the training. Trainees must develop the habit of consulting the manual for additional information or to clarify doubts, or it will never be used. During the training, ask trainees to keep the manual open on paper or as a soft copy on their device. After reading each question, ask trainees to check if there is a corresponding manual entry and to read it as well. To be correct, it must always be up to date. One of the trainers should update the manual directly during the training if the entry is unclear or insufficient. Ask for input from the class if needed and confirm with them if the updated entry is clear. Distribute updated soft copies of the manual to the team every morning/evening. Multi-language questionnaires. If the questionnaire has been translated into other languages, display the questionnaire in the common training language on the big screen and ask each trainee to follow the questionnaire on their tablet in the local language they are most likely to use. For each question, ask it to be read in the training and local languages. This serves to verify the translation and to familiarize trainees with the questionnaire in the local language. If the questionnaire has not been translated and interviewers are required to translate questions on-the-fly, ask interviewers to say out loud the translation for each question and ask the class for feedback. This serves to harmonize translations and for trainees to practice translating the instrument. CAPI. Training the questionnaires directly in CAPI, ensures not only understanding of the content and format of questions in CAPI but also demonstrates the flow of the questionnaire. This requires inputting different question routings so that every question is enabled and demonstrated at least once. If using Survey Solutions, set up the training version of the questionnaire so that disabled questions are still displayed. As you work through the questionnaire in CAPI, show and explain CAPI functionalities the first time they come up. On the big screen, demonstrate how the questionnaire should be filled in, how different question types function (e.g., text questions with patterns, search in combo box, etc.), point out instructions or other parts that are not meant to be read out, the overall organization of a section and how to navigate it, etc. Ask trainees to follow on their tablets. Demonstrate. Show how (groups of) questions or sections should be administered by role-playing that part of the interview in front of class. Trainers can participate and/or ask experienced trainees to act as respondent and interviewer. This is particularly useful for complex modules or parts that may require additional probing or may not be clear, e.g., probing for the age of household members, completing a roster for a child nutrition module, sketching a parcel map, etc. Trainees can follow and record the responses on their tablet. Give immediate feedback, highlight any mistakes and parts done well, and provide additional information if necessary. Update the questionnaire, CAPI &amp; translations. Depending on the level of pre-testing, piloting and subsequent change, the questionnaire, CAPI and translations may still contain issues that are uncovered during training. Ideally, trainers not actively leading the training can make immediate corrections (or at the very least maintain a record of such changes), as it tends to be less time consuming and allows corrected versions to be used sooner during the training. Be consistent and ensure the questionnaire, CAPI program, and all translations are the same. Follow updating protocols when making changes, e.g., update the live version of the paper questionnaire, the CAPI program and the translation sheet. Do NOT simply update the questionnaire on CAPI or in one language only, as this will lead to inconsistencies, mistakes and survey error. Ask the class for input if useful, e.g., how to phrase a question, or what answer categories exist. Practice with samples. For descriptive classifications (e.g., water source or stove type) or extracting information from documents it is important to expose trainees to a range of different scenarios and standardize their assessments. Bring a diverse set of samples so that trainees can practice assessing the documents or scenarios in a structured way. One option is to run through scenarios together – show photos of different water access points and ask trainees to record the appropriate response for each. Another option is to set up workstations with different scenarios and ask trainees to rotate through the stations, complete the required task and record the information on their tablets. For example, place different medication packages on different tables; trainees go from table to table, identifying each medication’s name, active ingredients and quantity and recording the information on their tablets. Trainers can staff individual stations and provide personal feedback to each trainee. 3.5 Interview practice Frequent practice is crucial for trainees to fully internalize the content and be able to apply it in the field. Do not leave interview practice to the end. Throughout the training, practice in groups, in front-of-class role-plays and with respondents on-site and in the field. Each of these practice modalities serves a different purpose. Towards the beginning of the training, frequent group practice and front-of-class role plays are effective ways for trainees to familiarize themselves with new parts of the questionnaire, learn how to administer them and practice using CAPI. Each day that new questionnaire content is introduced, hold practice sessions at natural content breaks (e.g., between questionnaire sections) to practice the material just covered. Immediately repeating newly learned material helps trainees to internalize it and uncovers doubts before adding new content. Alternating between training modalities (content review and practice sessions) also improves attention levels. When the entire day is dedicated to questionnaire content, aim to have 2-4 practice sessions, keeping in mind the time required to set up each practice. Once the entire questionnaire has been covered and practiced in pieces, practice full interviews with real respondents on-site and/or in the field. Trainees learn how to handle real respondents and how to conduct interviews under real field conditions – both of which are crucial in preparing trainees for fieldwork. If the interview is long, e.g., an LSMS-ISA style survey with separate household and agricultural questionnaires, it can be beneficial to conduct separate practices for each of the questionnaires. Early exposure during the training to real-world scenarios and respondents also makes the rest of the training more tangible for trainees. Trainees should practice the full questionnaire at least once, but ideally more often, with real respondents prior to the final field test. More details on each practice modality, including their objectives and how to best organize them, are provided in the sections below. 3.5.1 Group practice Group exercise is most effective in small groups of 2-8 trainees, followed by productive feedback sessions. When assigning groups, break up clusters that formed in the class and mix trainees so that low/high performers and those paying more/less attention are distributed. Change group composition between exercises. Tip: One option for quickly assigning well-mixed groups is to work out n, the number of groups needed, and point to each trainee while repeatedly counting aloud from 1 to n until each one is assigned a number. Each number corresponds to a group, and each group can meet in a different point of the training venue, e.g., “All number 4s, meet at the blackboard. All number 3s, at the door…”. For practice in groups of 2, pair trainees with their peers in the row in front/behind them. Each group practice should focus on the questionnaire sections that have been covered since the last practice session (regardless of practice modality). If there is extra time, they can also practice other sections previously covered in training, but they should not work on sections that have not yet been covered. Provide practice scenarios to trainees that are likely to occur in their local context. The scenarios should include sufficient details to ensure that key questions are filled out properly, addressing commonly encountered complex scenarios as well as scenarios that will take interviewers through the different question routings in the relevant section. For example, when practicing the labor section, ask groups to record different household members as employed, self-employed, supporting family worker, etc. Within each group, one trainee should ask the questions while another one answers them. Every few questions/sub-sections the roles should be rotated so that each trainee has the opportunity to act as interviewer or respondent. All trainees in the group should follow along on their own tablets and record the answers which, at the end, should be identical for everyone within the same group. Ask trainees to submit these interviews after the debrief session, further motivating them to correctly complete the section(s). Groups should also contribute to the debrief sessions by submitting written feedback. Simply asking the class if there were any doubts or comments is often met with general silence. Instead, set a minimum number of written feedback points that each group should submit at the end of the group practice, e.g., 3 during the beginning of training when less material has been covered, and at least 1 towards the end of the training. Feedback points can include any question or doubt about the questionnaire, definitions, scenarios, etc. or any mistakes they have found. During group practices, trainers observe groups allocated to them, correct mistakes and help struggling trainees on the spot. While observing, they should also rate and record trainees’ skill levels and give individual feedback where necessary. They should take note of any issues to share during the debrief session, including the way questions were read or answered, the intonation, misunderstandings, questionnaire navigation, CAPI use, etc. Debrief with the entire class immediately after the group practice. Discuss their written feedback and answer questions by involving input from other teams/trainees. Ask trainers to provide feedback based on their observations, explaining what was done wrong and how to do it correctly. Trainees who were observed doing specific details well can be asked to demonstrate to the class (e.g., how to explain a concept/question to a respondent), so that everyone learns from good examples. 3.5.2 Front-of-class role-play Asking trainees to conduct (parts of) an interview in front of the class is a good way to demonstrate how interviews should (and should not) be conducted and to evaluate trainee skills. It also shows whether the class is able to spot any mistakes made and allows trainers to provide feedback on interviewing to the entire class. It is a good means of practicing (portions of) the questionnaire before practicing the entire questionnaire with respondents on-site. It is particularly useful for critical and complex sections that require more back-and-forth and judgement by the interviewer, such as food consumption modules. This exercise usually takes much longer than a normal interview, so plan accordingly. Project onto the big screen the tablet that will be used to record responses throughout the role play. It is best to not change the tablet during the exercise. Start by selecting one trainee to come to the front and act as interviewer. Select one at random that has not yet been to the front. It usually makes sense to rotate trainees after a few questions (around 5-10) – this gives more trainees the opportunity to practice in the front and makes the exercise less monotonous. Select a few trainee-interviewer at a time and have them wait at the front of the room, so the rotation of trainees does not take up too much time. Select someone to act as respondent throughout the whole exercise. This can be another trainee, or preferably one of the trainers or a real respondent. The benefit of using a trainer is that they can guide the interview details with their answers and probe if some scenarios are understood. For real respondents, hire a person similar to the surveyed population to visit the training venue for an afternoon/morning. These real respondents expose trainees to scenarios and respondents that are similar to what they will experience in the field. Ask the interviewing trainee to administer the questions as if they were in a real interview and to record the responses on the tablet that is projected onto the big screen. The respondent should give normal responses with some difficult scenarios. Ask the rest of the class to follow the interview and raise their hand if they have a question or comment about it. Pause the interview and give immediate feedback if the interviewer could have done better. Also highlight what they have done well, so it is clear to the class how the questionnaire should be administered. Consider all aspects of the interview process, including tone of voice, reading speed, way of inquiring, etc. Ask the class for input, e.g., if they spotted a mistake or have any ideas how to do it better. Ask the trainee to repeat the question, taking into account the input. All trainees should follow along with the front-of-class interview and record responses on their own tablets. At the end, their interview files should look the same. Asking the class to submit their interview files after the exercise is an effective way to encourage them to follow closely and record everything. 3.5.3 On-site respondents Practicing with real respondents on-site is a great way to give trainees more and early exposure to real-world scenarios, while keeping the logistical effort and required training time low. Trainees learn how to apply the theory they learned and how to handle real respondents. Another advantage is that trainers can observe all or most trainees conducting interviews, which is nearly impossible during field practicing when they are scattered across many homes. The best time for on-site practice is after the questionnaire has been covered completely, including both group practices and role playing, and prior to field practice. For long questionnaires (or surveys with multiple questionnaires), it can be beneficial to practice with respondents on site after the first part of the questionnaire has been covered, before the second part is trained. This allows trainees to practice and internalize the first part and provides earlier exposure to real respondents and scenarios. Hire a group of respondents to visit the training venue, or another convenient location, where they will be interviewed. Ideally, arrange one respondent for every 4-5 trainees. They should be similar to respondents in the surveyed population, e.g., cultivate land and keep livestock in agricultural surveys, or have jobs or small businesses in labor force surveys, etc. Make sure to compensate respondents adequately, pay for their transport as well as refreshments and lunch or invite them to the training lunch. For the on-site practice, group trainees into as many groups as you have respondents. Each group should conduct one full interview with the respondent, taking turns as the interviewer, e.g., asking a few questions or a section at a time. All trainees should follow along on their own devices and record responses. Group members should support each other if individuals fall behind, have questions or make mistakes. If there is sufficient time, groups can switch respondents and conduct a second (or even third) interview. Observe, collect feedback and debrief in the same way as described above for group practice. Ask everyone to submit/sync their interviews after the feedback session to further motivate them to implement it correctly. 3.5.4 Field practice The purpose of field practice is for trainees to get first-hand experience implementing the questionnaire with real respondents in real settings. There is no need to completely mimic listing assignments or replacement protocols as is done in dress rehearsals. Rather, aim to maximize the number of interviews each trainee can conduct and the number of respondents and scenarios they are exposed to. Be well prepared for field practice, observe trainees and collect good feedback to make it a success. Warning: Field practice is often implemented inefficiently with a lot of time wasted on logistics that could have been prepared in advance: Teams waiting for transport, community introductions, looking for respondents, etc. It is not uncommon that, during a whole day of field practice, trainees only manage to practice for 1 hour or do not practice at all because they do not find any respondents. Prepare well so trainees can practice how to interview - not how to wait. Field practice sessions should be held after the questionnaire has been trained and practiced in class, and before the final dress rehearsal at the end of the training. Often, it also makes sense to conduct this prior to training sessions on household tracking, receiving rejecting interviews, logistics etc., so that the field test can focus only on the understanding and implementation of the questionnaire. For very long questionnaires (or surveys with multiple questionnaires), it is usually helpful to conduct separate field practices for each of the questionnaires. Try to be efficient when conducting field practices: if relatively short or only parts of a questionnaire are tested, half-day field practices are often sufficient to give some exposure to trainees and identify issues to be addressed prior to the next field practice. Since it is usually difficult to conduct classroom training after returning from the field, try to conduct these shorter field practices in the afternoon, so you can use the morning to train. Visit communities that are not too far from the training venue and large enough to have sufficient respondents for all trainees. Practice communities should have similar characteristics to the surveyed communities but should not be part of the sample. Ask support staff or fieldwork management (i.e., those not engaged in the training) to contact or visit the communities the day prior to the field practice, do the community introduction and arrange for respondents at the time of your expected arrival, e.g., with the help of a community leader. Compensating respondents for their participation often helps with their availability and willingness to participate and is usually acceptable during field practice. Again, the aim is for trainees to practice the questionnaire as much as possible with respondents. Try to minimize other logistical issues that could cause delays. Make sure all tablets are fully charged, synchronized and have battery packs available if needed. Arrange for food and drinks for trainees in the field or ask them to bring them. Make sure your transport arrives on time, knows the way and does not need to stop for petrol. Try to arrive early in communities, as respondents tend to become unavailable during lunch hours. Group trainees into groups of two, pairing high performers with low performers when possible. Allocate a respondent to each pair. Agree on a meeting place for trainees to return to and a time by which they need to return. If they complete their interviews early, they should return – ideally, to be assigned another interview. Similar to on-site group practices, trainees should take turns interviewing the respondent while both record responses, and then submit the interview files at the end of the day. Working in pairs, one of them can take notes on any issues while the other one is interviewing. They should write down any issues they experience while conducting the interview. Ask each pair to also list at least one question or doubt they had, and something about their interview or respondent that was noteworthy and is useful to share with the class. Try to observe as many of the pairs as possible, help and correct where necessary, mark their skills, and note down any issues you have observed as general feedback for the class. Focus on trainees that are borderline of being selected or that have not been marked yet. Collect as much feedback as possible from trainees before you leave the community. Interviewer recall becomes much harder later and the quality of feedback decreases rapidly. As pairs of trainees return to the meeting place, ask for their written notes, debrief quickly with each pair, clarify any issues they had and record general feedback for the class. Warning: Often trainers assume that the questionnaire is working well and that interviewers are able to administer it correctly because they did not report any issues during feedback sessions. This assumption is wrong. Many issues cannot be identified by interviewers, are forgotten or not reported. Those reported are biased towards trainees’ convenience, e.g., they are quick to report something that caused them extra effort. Trainers must observe interviews being conducted and compile their own feedback. To receive meaningful feedback from trainees, trainees must note down issues or questions as they experience them and must be debriefed shortly after conducting interviews. After each field test, hold a general debrief session with the entire class in which you respond to the written feedback from the team, answer any questions, and provide feedback from your observations. This might involve short retraining of concepts or questions that have been ill understood, practice or role-playing. Clarify all issues prior to the next field test. It is normal for quite a few things to go wrong in the first field test and to improve quickly. Sometimes, you can debrief to some extent directly in the field – in an empty classroom, a community center, the shadow of a big tree, etc. This way, interviews are still fresh in everyone’s head and there is no need to go back to the classroom after the transport back from the field. If you are required to debrief the same day in the classroom, make sure to leave the field in time and to allow for a long break, as everyone tends to be really tired after field practice, especially after the transport back. Design your training schedule such that field practice days are followed by classroom days, so you can have a detailed debrief session in the classroom with the big screen and all other required facilities. 3.6 Interview techniques In addition to understanding the questionnaire content, interviewers must master a range of interviewing techniques that are crucial to collect good quality data. Some examples are: Introduction. Being able to introduce themselves, clearly explain the purpose of the survey and what participation entails are key determinants of respondent’s participation and the perception of the survey and institution on the ground. Securing consent. The ability to persuade reluctant respondents to participate in the survey is crucial to keeping unit non-response error low, particularly in urban areas or other settings with high refusal rates. Interview continuation. Avoiding partial refusals (interviews ending before being completed) by keeping respondents engaged in lengthy interviews minimizes item non-response and measurement error. Probing. Respondents often do not understand or misinterpret a question, give incomplete answers, respond “I don’t know” or do not want to disclose some information. Interviewers need to be able to inquire in a neutral and non-leading manner to reduce item non-response without introducing bias. Controlling interviews. Respondents sometimes digress, give lengthy explanations, or talk about other things. Interviewers need to be able to lead the conversation in a pleasant and courteous manner to maintain the respondent’s focus on the interview. Warning: Unfortunately, interview techniques are rarely trained. Instead, it is assumed that interviewers automatically know them or will learn them over the course of the survey. In reality, while some interviewers are experienced or naturally good at it, many others struggle or resort to undesirable practices such as making false promises to obtain consent or probing with leading questions. This can exacerbate interviewer effects and lead to high levels of measurement error and unit and item non-response. Training on interview techniques mitigates these effects, e.g., see Groves and McGonagle (2001). Teaching interviewing techniques goes beyond theory. Interaction between interviewers and respondents encompasses all features of communication, including the choice of words, tone of voice and volume, as well as attitude, facial expressions and body language. To learn a technique, trainees need to see and hear examples of what should and should not be done. To apply these techniques correctly, trainees need to repeatedly practice and receive feedback until they can (re)act correctly and quickly. The interviewing techniques to be trained depend on the survey and what challenges are expected in the field. For example, refusals may be rare in a household survey but very frequent in an enterprise survey, which would require dedicated training on how to address them. In addition, best practices should be tailored to the culture and context, e.g., how to inquire if respondents are hesitant to disclose their income. 3.6.1 Identify challenges and responses To determine which interviewing techniques should be trained, identify which ones are most relevant for the survey. Start by compiling a list of key challenges that interviewers are expected to face in the field, focusing on those that are most common and have the biggest effect on survey error. Consider any response, concern or action by the respondent or any other situation that can negatively affect data quality if interviewers do not apply the correct technique. Examples are: Respondents refusing an interview, stating reasons related to time, etc. Other household members being present during sections that should be administered in private. Respondents being unable or hesitant to quantify consumption amounts. Long and damaging interview breaks due to a tablet needing to be restarted. Error messages flagging gross mismatches in harvest quantities, land size or sale prices. List different ways in which a challenge may manifest itself so that interviewers can recognize them in the field. Include phrases and colloquial terms a respondents would use. As an example, when refusing and stating reasons related to time, respondents may say “I am really busy”, “I need to leave” or “I need to cook/wash/…” when refusing and stating reasons related to time. For each challenge, identify good interviewer responses. These can include verbal responses, actions or procedures. Often, there is no single response that works equally well with all respondents and in all circumstances. Good interviewers often have a repertoire of responses and tailor them to observable features of the respondent or the context. For example, if a respondent refused based on time and appears to be rushed or pre-occupied with something (e.g., fussing with children) the best response tends to be to ask for a different moment, e.g., by saying “I see that now it is difficult. When would be a good moment for me to come back?”. However, if the respondent refuses because they have to do a chore but seems generally collaborative, it is often good to offer to do the interview while they do their activity. For each challenge, also identify bad practices or responses that interviewers should avoid, if any. As an example, if respondents do not know the quantity of rice consumed, a bad probing practice would be to ask “Was it maybe 1 kg?”, as this is leading the respondent to your suggested answer. Allocate challenges and their responses into separate topics, taking into account importance and anticipated time required to train each. It is usually good to have at least one module on Introduction and securing consent, one on Inquiring and controlling interviews and one on Challenges observed during field testing. You might need additional modules on key questions or sections, such as Estimating land size or Completing a consumption module. Ideally, challenges and their responses should be compiled prior to the training to facilitate planning and make training sessions more productive. Use a combination of any of the following sources to identify challenges and responses: Experience from previous surveys with similar context, populations and subject. Focus groups with experienced interviewers. Observations and feedback from pre-test or pilots. If you are unable to prepare prior to the training, use challenges and responses observed during field practice sessions or hold short “focus groups” with the class at the beginning of each module. 3.6.2 Train &amp; practice Schedule training modules on interviewing techniques just prior to field practice and final field test so trainees can apply the techniques soon after. You might need to schedule additional training after field practice and field test to address new situations that came up or retrain those that were not yet implemented well. Modules between 45 min and 1.5 hours tend to be sufficient to cover each core topic. For each module, first train interviewers on what challenges are likely to occur and what are the best responses. Project onto the big screen the list of challenges (by categories) and good responses. Work through each category by encouraging the class to identify ways in which challenges may manifest themselves and discussing any tips and tricks for a good response. Also cover bad practices that interviewers should avoid. Try to keep this presentation brief so that more time can be spent on discussion and practice. To establish best practices, identify trainees who are good at a particular task (either because of their interview experience or good interpersonal skills) and ask them to role play in front of the class. Give feedback if necessary and ask the class for input to reach consensus on responses that are appropriate for culture and context. Trainees should then do practice drills until they are able to respond to a challenge quickly, correctly and naturally. This is best done by asking trainees to role play the interviewer-respondent interactions in front of class. Select one trainee to act as interviewer. Another trainee can act as respondent, though usually it is more useful for a trainer to act as respondent, guiding the conversation as needed. Explain the scenario and challenge and ask the participants to role play as if it was a real field situation, speaking loudly so the entire class can hear. Give immediate feedback on what they have done well (and what they have not). Ask the class for input and if the response can be improved, ask the trainee, or another trainee, to repeat the scene. Repeat these steps until there is agreement that the scene is done well. Allow time for as many trainees as possible to practice role playing. Depending on class size and skill level, the class may need to be divided into large groups, each supervised by a trainer. This can be a fun way to train and also a good way of breaking up longer theoretical sessions. Two examples to illustrate: To practice introduction to the survey, select one trainee and ask them to stand up. Tell them to imagine they have just knocked on a door and they need to introduce themselves. Evaluate their role play based on whether they provide all necessary information, say nothing wrong, are easy to understand, use the right tone of voice, have good facial expressions and gestures, etc. Collect feedback from the class. If needed, ask the trainee to repeat their introduction until it is correct in content and well presented. To practice securing consent, select a trainee to introduce themselves as above. Another trainee or a trainer acts as a reluctant respondent, stating one of the challenges discussed in the training, such as “I am really busy now” or “What do I get out of this?”. The “interviewer” must try to persuade the “respondent” to participate. Again, together with the class, check if the trainee’s response was quick, correct and natural. Give feedback on possible improvements and let the trainee repeat the scene until satisfactory. 3.7 Expert measurements In some surveys, fieldworkers take measurements that require relatively skilled expertise and thus need special attention during training. Examples include: Anthropometry – height and weight measurements, middle upper arm circumference. Agriculture – plot size measurements, soil samples, crop cuttings. Learning assessments – testing literacy or numeracy, early childhood motor skills. Medical tests – measuring blood pressure or hemoglobin levels, testing for specific illnesses. Environmental – water sampling and quality testing, lead paint testing. For these specialized measurements to be accurate and precise, fieldworkers usually need to correctly handle specialized equipment and strictly follow testing procedures. For example, in learning outcome assessment tests, interviewers need to simultaneously handle testing booklets, a timer, and the CAPI questionnaire, while proctoring a young child and maintaining a neutral testing environment. For water quality tests, interviewers need to handle the testing equipment and respect the procedures for taking and testing water samples to ensure reliable results. Learning to implement any of those tasks at sufficiently high standards usually takes several days. Trainees need to learn theory and practice extensively to gain confidence and be able to consistently take quick and accurate measurements. In many cases, repeated standardization exercises are needed to streamline the way trainees conduct the measurements to ensure their reliability and validity. If the available training time does not allow for trainees to adequately learn and practice both interviewing and specialized measurements, fieldworker roles can be split - some will conduct interviews while others will focus only on taking measurements. Measurement specialist training can take place in parallel to interviewer training, either at any time from the start of fieldwork training (e.g., if a special profile is required, such as trained nurses), or at a point during training when it becomes possible to assess which trainees are better suited for which role. To effectively and efficiently train measurement experts, cover the four training modules below. 3.7.1 Theory First, cover the theory including background and purpose; functionality; calibration and use of equipment; detailed steps of the measurement procedure; things to be aware of or to avoid; how to answer common respondent questions; etc. Make this part tangible for trainees by including demonstrations by experts or videos showing the correct use of tools and measurement procedures. Test the trainees’ understanding using written tests. 3.7.2 Practice each component Second, practice as much as possible all components of the measurement process, such as setting up testing equipment, taking the sample or reading the measurement. Drill trainees on each component until they can implement them routinely, quickly and correctly. Breaking down the tools and procedures of the overall measurement process helps trainees become familiar with the tasks while not getting overwhelmed. Since test subjects (e.g., children, adults, variety of water sources) might be hard to come by and testing kits can have expensive per-unit costs, another benefit of practicing individual components first is that resources are put to better use. As an example, when training on anthropometric measurements for children, the following components can be practiced separately: Set-up and handling of equipment. Scales, height and length boards need to be correctly packed, unpacked, and carried around the training center to simulate how they will be carried throughout communities. Trainees also need to practice setting up on uneven terrain. Scales should be calibrated or calibration checked. Measurement procedures. (The type of scales available will inform the measurement procedures). First the caretaker steps onto the scale alone. The specialist either records this weight or sets the tare. Then the child is handed to the caretaker. Finally, the specialist records this reading (to be practiced as a separate step). This process can be easily practiced by trainees using backpacks of various weights in place of the children. Taking and reading measurements. Especially for length, measurers only have a moment to read the measurement, as children are prone to fidgeting out of the measurement position. Depending on the length board, taking the measurement quickly is far from straightforward and requires a significant amount of practice. A significant amount of error can be eliminated at this stage simply by repeated practicing. Practice by asking trainees to measure things (of lengths known to trainers only) and gradually decrease the time available per item. Compare individual measurements to the known length. 3.7.3 Practice full measurements Third, once trainees have a good command of each component, bring it all together by practicing the entire process with actual subjects or real samples. Provide enough and diverse subjects/samples, rotating them so that trainees can practice repeatedly and are exposed to different scenarios/cases. For example, for plot measurements, trainees can travel in teams to nearby farm households to measure their fields. Observe trainees and provide immediate feedback to individuals or the entire class. Trouble shoot any issues and re-practice individual components if needed. Practice until trainees can implement the entire measurement procedure correctly and have developed a good routine for it. 3.7.4 Standardize Fourth, conduct standardization exercises to improve the accuracy and precision of trainees’ measurements. In standardization exercises, trainees’ measurements are compared against one another and against those of an expert. The exercises serve to identify and eliminate as much as possible any idiosyncratic measurement practices trainees might have which would cause measurements to deviate from the true value. It also serves as a tests for the final selection of fieldworkers. Hold standardization exercises towards the end of training, once trainees can implement the measurement procedures reliably and quickly. Often, it is useful to hold at least two separate standardization exercises, 1-2 days apart to allow time to retrain and practice as needed. For a standardization exercise, set up stations with subjects/samples. For example, for water testing this can be printed photos of water sources (for identification/classification practice), bottles of water from those sources, and the equipment required for testing the water. Ideally, stations have variation in characteristics to expose trainees to a range of scenarios, e.g., pictures of different water sources and water of differing qualities for all the parameters being tested, etc. The number of stations required depends on the number of trainees. It should be large enough for each trainee to get enough practice and exposure to different scenarios. For larger groups of trainees, it might be best to split trainees into groups and let each group rotate through a subset of stations. Consider the burden on the persons who form part of the station, especially on children for anthropometric measurements. Start by having the expert measurer take two independent measurements at each station and record the values. Their measurements serve as the benchmark against which trainee measurements are compared and should not be shared with trainees. Subsequently, trainees should rotate between all stations and take their own measurements. Use different starting points or directions to speed things up and avoid queues at individual stations. Trainees should record their measurements at each station, together with the station name/ID and their own name. This can be done on paper and later entered into a spreadsheet or, ideally, using a short, customized CAPI questionnaire, Google Form or the like. Observe trainees and provide immediate feedback (during practice, not testing). Try to identify why their measurements are deviating and what they need to do to correct it, e.g., extend the child’s legs more to not under-measure their length. Ideally, two independent rounds of measurement should be taken, so that each trainee has measured each station twice. The difference between the first and second round of measurements for each trainee at each station is an indication of the precision/reliability of the measurements. The difference between the measurements taken by trainees and by the expert is indicative of their accuracy/validity. Calculate and interpret the technical error of measurement (TEM) to assess the variation of measurements taken by each trainee. For more details, see e.g., WHO/UNICEF guide on anthropometry in children &lt; 5. Tools: WHO/UNICEF guide on anthropometry for children &lt; 5 Video on anthropometric measurements (French) Video on LandInfo module for soil characterization and identification 3.8 Pre-interview tasks Interviewers have some tasks that must be done before they begin an interview; These actions and the tools for them need to be covered during training. Examples are: Identifying &amp; locating/tracking of respondents. Selection protocols, if the fieldwork includes sampling. Using the identifier system and assignment cards. Completing the questionnaire cover and creating an interview file. Revisit and replacement protocols. Usually, it is best to train pre-interview tasks and tools towards the end of the training, just before interviewers are able to apply this knowledge in the field. By immediately putting the lessons into practice, trainees learn the tools and tasks more quickly. At this point in the training, they are also already familiar with the CAPI tool and overall questionnaire content, making details like questionnaire identifiers and revisit protocols less abstract. Although these pre-interview tasks will be the starting point for interviewers during field work, it is usually not effective to teach these at the beginning of training. Trainees will learn a lot of other material before they practice these tasks and may forget what was taught before they can apply it. Good moments to train pre-interview tasks are the day prior to field practice and/or the day prior to the final field test, when these components are more tangible. Most pre-interview tasks are best trained hands-on with concrete examples. Prepare samples of the tools that can be used during training. For example, to train tracking sheets, household identifiers, assignments and how they link, show the tracking sheet for one PSU together with corresponding assignments and demonstrate how they relate. Use the PSUs of the final field test to reduce the preparation effort (The tools need to be prepared anyway for final field test) and to make it very tangible for trainees (they will use them the following day). Ensure trainees have sufficient practice time, especially if any of the tasks are complicated, e.g., the use of Kish grids for in-field unit selection. 3.9 Post-interview tasks After completing an interview, there are additional tasks for interviewers to conduct, such as checking for completion, responding to feedback or inquiries, correcting mistakes, revisiting respondents, etc. These tasks are often underdefined and insufficiently trained, which can result in significant measurement and processing error. For example, interviewers may be inclined to “fix” interviews by simply changing recorded responses to make issues go away, without actually addressing the underlying problem. A dedicated module towards the end of the training is needed to teach interviewers what they must – and must not – do. For surveys conducted in Survey Solutions, one of the main post-interview tasks is to review and respond to rejected interview files. This is used as an example to illustrate how these tasks can be trained. The same principles also apply to other tasks. Reviewing and responding to rejected interview files is best trained practically, by looking at actual examples. Ideally, trainees can practice with interview files they have produced themselves. This can also show trainees the mistakes they made and how to prevent them in the future. Use interview files from the field practice or even better, the final field test because these interviews will generally be of better quality and be produced under conditions most similar to fieldwork. Prior to training this module, trainers should carefully review submitted interviews and flag any issues. Normally, the first few interviews tend to have at least one issue per interview. In addition, trainers can also create some scenarios that include specific challenges they want to ensure are practiced. Trainers should write comments and feedback in the interviews as would be done during fieldwork and then reject the interviews so that they bounce back to the interviewer. This should be done with at least one file per trainee (or pair of trainees working together during field test). To train these tasks, first give a quick general introduction of the rejected files tab on the interviewer dashboard, explaining how to open a rejected file, how to read the rejection comment, and how to see all and respond to supervisor comments. Also review how to process, resubmit, and sync rejected files. Then, project one of the rejected interviews to the main screen and ask the responsible trainee/pair to come to the front. They should explain what led to their mistake and what they could do if this occurred during fieldwork. Ask them to respond to the issues and resubmit the file on screen. Ask the class to help and comment. Repeat this with as many files/trainees as possible and useful. Ask all trainees who did not solve their file on the big screen to solve it on their tablet and resubmit them. This exercise is also a great way to identify and streamline the rules around responding to rejected files, revisiting respondents, etc. If any changes are made, update the manual to reflect this. 3.10 Final field test (often called pilot) At the end of the training but prior to starting field work, a final field test should be conducted in which all survey questionnaires and protocols are tested under real field conditions. It is an important exercise that will: Expose interviewers to field-like conditions and give them the opportunity to practice without affecting the sample Determine if the field team is ready for field work Identify and address any outstanding issues with questionnaire or field procedures In surveys that do not conduct a separate pilot exercise prior to the training, the final field test is effectively also the pilot (and is referred to as such), in which questionnaires and protocols undergo their first reality check under field conditions. This should be avoided when possible and a separate pilot should be held (see details here). Usually, 2-3 days of final field testing are necessary but also sufficient. If short debriefing/feedback sessions can be held at the end of each day (or at the start of the next day), they can be on sequential days. If not, schedule debriefing/feedback days between field days. Allow for at least one classroom day after the final field test for an extensive feedback session and to teach how to deal with rejected files, inquiries from HQ or any other post-interview tasks. Additionally, you might need to allow additional time for administrative details, rest days or travel time. To create conditions as close to fieldwork as possible, the final field test must be conducted with units that are similar to those in the survey sample but, crucially, that are not part of the sample. For household surveys, this usually means conducting the final field test in un-selected enumeration areas within the survey areas and will sometimes require the team to travel from the training location closer to the selected areas. For surveys that are part of RCTs, this means practicing within the treatment areas. Ideally, the final field test should be located where the entire field team can be supervised and debriefed together in a central location. This ensures that all field workers receive the same input and reduces team effect. If there is a large variability in the sample, split the final field test into multiple locations so that all questionnaire modules and protocols are tested. If doing so, try to streamline as much as possible the supervision and feedback given to all groups, e.g., by trainers exchanging notes before providing feedback to their respective groups. Test all components of fieldwork, not just how interviews are conducted. This can include activities such as listing and selection of survey units (e.g., households), interviewer assignments, identification and tracking of units (especially for panel surveys), convincing respondents to participate, making appointments and managing time, the flow of the interview through the review/approval process, among others. Trainees should experience the same sort of challenges and issues that will be encountered during actual fieldwork. Do not pre-arrange respondents as one would do during field practice, as this does not reflect real field conditions. If non–response is high, you might need to relax replacement protocols and add additional replacement units to ensure all trainees practice at least some interviews. Equip interviewers with the same assignments and/or tracking sheets they would receive during field work. Often it is easiest to select the test EAs during the main sample design and include them in all preparation steps, such as assigning EA IDs and adding them to the CAPI questionnaire, procuring reference data/maps, conducting community sensitization, conducting listing exercise (e.g., as part of final field test in lister training), selection of units, producing tracking sheets and assignments, etc. Preparing testing PSUs separately can be very laborious and cumbersome. If you are unable to prepare listings (e.g., households, respondents) as part of the final field test exercise, send someone to the communities prior to the test to compile a listing. Use the listing to produce the assignments/tracking sheets so that interviewers receive them exactly as they would during fieldwork. Tip: When doing the final field test for a panel survey’s second (or later) wave, use households that are being ‘retired’ from the panel as they have similar panel features – tracking down of previously interviewed households, interaction with respondents that were previously interviewed, how to navigate interviews with pre-loaded questionnaire data, etc. Allocate interviewers to field teams and let supervisors assume their management role, including the assignment of cases to interviewers. For the final field test, it is often beneficial for interviewers to conduct interviews in pairs. This reduces the number of cases required in any of the visited communities, increases the probability of finding available respondents and allows interviewers to help one another. Each pair can conduct multiple interviews per day and take turns in administering the questionnaire. As in the field practice, both interviewers should record all answers on their own tablet and submit the interview in the end. For the final field test, you might need to relax replacement protocols and add additional replacement units, so interviewers can practice conducting some interviews even if non–response is high. Make sure field teams arrive early in the communities, so that interviewers have enough time to locate cases and conduct interviews before respondents start cooking/having lunch and become unavailable. As for the field practice, make all necessary logistical arrangements to prevent delays or hungry/thirsty field workers in the field. Collect feedback and debrief as described for field practice. Ask all interviewers to submit their interviews at the end of the day. Use the data to finalize your data system and quality control system, e.g., by updating the data checks. Review submitted interviews using the standard processes of the quality control system. In addition, visually review as many cases as possible and compile feedback for interviewers and the quality assurance team. The data collected during dress rehearsal is a great way to learn and practice receiving feedback with the team, see chapter feedback. 3.11 Supervisor training A short training for supervisors is required to prepare them for their role. It should be held outside the hours of the main fieldworker training so supervisors can attend both. Being fully trained as interviewers will allow them to better supervise interviewers. If supervisors are pre-determined, a short supervisor training can be held prior to the start of the main fieldworker training that covers administrative and logistical matters that do not build upon the main fieldworker training. If supervisors are selected from the pool of fieldworker trainees, try to select supervisors and conduct part of their training prior to the final field test. This way supervisors can practice their role during the final field test while being observed/evaluated by trainers. Depending on the tasks their role entails, 1-2 days of supervisor training tend to be sufficient. Use the afternoons, evenings or any rest or administrative days after the main fieldworker training. If supervisors are required to conduct interviews for support questionnaires (e.g., community or market), significantly more training time is required. Prior to supervisor training, supervisor tasks should be clearly defined and written up in a supervisor manual. The content of the supervisor training tends to be very survey dependent. It can include topics such as: Supervisor responsibilities PSU tracking and community introductions Workload management, including assignment of units to interviewers Quality assurance checks of complete interviews (any unanswered questions, errors, comments?) Checking PSU completion Observing interviews, conducting back-checks Administrative and logistical matters, such as handling finances, accommodation, transport, etc. Use the final field test to train supervisors on tasks that are best learned by doing. This will provide concrete examples of the types of issues that will need to be addressed during fieldwork and can significantly reduce problems during the beginning of field work, such as incomplete interviews or PSUs. For example, if the supervisor tasks include checking completed interviews against a checklist, they can take turns reviewing a few interviews from the final field test on the big screen while the rest of the supervisors follow along and provide feedback. If their responsibilities include checking PSUs for completion, review with all supervisors the completion status of each of the final field test PSUs, showing how to cross check with tracking sheets. Although supervisors will be the first point of quality assurance for submitted interviews–checking completion and basic quality assurance of interviews – in-depth data monitoring should be conducted by centralized data monitors to reduce data monitoring effect. Should supervisors be assigned (greater parts of) this role, they need to also be trained as data monitors (see details in the following sub-chapter). 3.12 Data monitor training Data monitor training is an important component of quality assurance in surveys. It serves to: Prepare data monitors for their role, so they can correctly identify issues in the received data, conduct back-checking exercises, take the appropriate actions and provide meaningful feedback. Harmonize data monitoring as much as possible, to ensure all field teams receive the same level of scrutiny and to reduce the data monitor effect. Improve the data monitoring process. The issues occurring in a survey and the actions required by data monitors tend to differ from survey to survey. Extensive practice using cases from the actual survey is a great way to refine the tools, processes and tasks of data monitors, improving the overall interview review process. The data monitor training is best held after the final field test, once a good number of interviews created under near-field conditions are available for practice. Importantly, this also allows data monitors to attend the main fieldworker training, providing a solid understanding of the content and the field activities they will be monitoring. Data monitors must be trained and ready to start their work as soon as the first interviews are synced and available for review, typically on Day 2 of fieldwork. It is critical that fieldworkers receive timely feedback, especially at the very start of fieldwork, and that a backlog of un-reviewed cases does not build up. In most cases, 2-3 days of data monitoring training is sufficient, provided trainers are also available to supervise and work closely with them during the first few days of fieldwork. The training can be held in the afternoons or evenings of the last few days of fieldwork training. If data monitors will work from a central location, training can be conducted on the day the field teams travel to the field and the first day(s) of fieldwork before cases become available for review. Prior to the data monitor training, prepare a short manual that clearly defines their tasks, procedures, checklist, etc. (see an example here). Add to the manual a list of scenarios that data monitors will face frequently and the actions they should take. For example, If GPS question is missing -&gt; troubleshoot tablet's location setup with interviewer. If not working -&gt; report to survey management. If working -&gt; Check if they can revisit household. If yes -&gt; reject interview back to the interviewer to make another attempt. If no -&gt; comment in interview file, explaining the nature of the GPS issue. Alternatively, the list of common issues and responses can be prepared as a Google sheet or similar file that is made available to data monitors for their regular reference. Update and refine the list throughout training and the beginning of fieldwork. At the start of data monitor training, provide each trainee with material that data monitors will need to do their work, such as copies of interview cases, back-check questionnaires, tablets or laptops, reports, etc. Begin training by covering all theory and an overview of expected tasks and procedures. While the details depend on the survey, this may include: A general overview of the quality assurance process and the data monitor’s role in it How to use tools or software required for their role, such as Survey Solutions Supervisor interface, dashboards, etc. How to check interview completion, use field check tables, etc. How to review submitted interviews, what to check for, interpreting error messages, etc. How to back-check cases, conduct re-interviews and audio audits, etc. How to provide feedback to field teams and report to survey management Keep presentations concise to allow more time for hands-on training. For example, while explaining how to review an interview file in Survey Solutions, data monitors can follow along on their own devices, immediately practicing how to find comments, see unanswered questions, approve/reject cases, etc. Next, allot as much time as possible for data monitoring practice so trainees learn and internalize their tasks. Do this using real interviews that are not part of the main sample, such as interviews from field practices. Ideally, use interviews from the final field test, as they more closely resemble the data from actual fieldwork. Using these interviews makes the training more tangible for data monitors, as they can see the types of issues that are likely to occur during field work and learn how to address them. Another key outcome of the training is to harmonize behavior across data monitors. Use the practice to update and refine the data monitoring process, i.e., the list of key issues to check, types of feedback they should provide and actions they need to take. An easy-to-prepare and very effective way to practice is to first run through a couple of cases together. Project the necessary material on the big screen in front of class and ask one data monitor to come to the front and work through the case on the big screen. Ask the others to observe and provide input. Provide immediate input if they have done something wrong, missed something, but also if they have done things correctly. Discuss any points of doubt and update procedures if necessary. Repeat this with other cases and other data monitors until all data monitors have worked through several cases. Another effective training approach (more demanding in the preparation) is to provide the same case for all data monitors to work through and then compare results. As an example, provide each data monitor with the audio recording of the same interview, and ask them to fill in an auditing form while listening to the interview. Once complete, compare the forms as a class, discuss any discrepancies and reiterate important points. Practice until data monitors are able to correctly and consistently implement all tasks, until you have run out of practicing cases, or until field work has started. Once the first data is received from the field, it is important that data monitors shift to working on these actual survey cases. Often, however, at this stage data monitors are not fully prepared to implement all monitoring tasks in a consistent, harmonized way. Therefore, it is paramount that data monitors are closely supervised by one of the trainers during the first few days. Good and transparent communication channels between data monitors and survey management are necessary from the start of data monitoring. This will allow management to reply to troubleshooting and protocol clarifications in a way that enables both timely workflow and consistency in how issues are addressed throughout fieldwork. If working from a central location, data monitors should work from the same room so they can quickly exchange troubleshooting ideas and issues with each other and one of the trainers can observe and provide feedback as necessary. If working from different locations, a common group chat or channel on WhatsApp, Teams, etc. should be set up to facilitate quick and easy communication and ensure all data monitors receive the same information. Data monitors should immediately communicate on the common channel if they have any doubts about a case or scenario or if they have made any noteworthy observations. If necessary, update the manual, tools or processes based on their findings. Conduct spot checks of some of the cases that have been reviewed by data monitors. Hold regular debriefs with all data monitors to provide feedback. Although survey management will not be directly involved in the day-to-day data monitoring tasks, they should still be trained on all monitoring outputs so that they understand the basics of the data monitoring tasks and systems and are able to monitor and use the dashboards, reports, etc. and are capable of taking action on them, if needed.

Continuously assess trainee performance and select interviewers, supervisors and other positions at the end of the training, based on their demonstrated capacity. Selection should be informed by trainees’ understanding of the survey content as evaluated in written tests, by other relevant skills and characteristics observed throughout training, and (in some cases) by standardization tests. Excess fieldworkers need to be trained to implement a competitive selection process. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate trainees and select fieldworkers. Assessment-based selection of fieldworkers serves several important functions: Improves overall fieldworker capacity. Most importantly, selecting fieldworkers based on their ability to perform well ensures a high capability level among fieldworkers. Other selection criteria, such as experience or seniority (time with the organization) are often insufficient or even counterproductive – experienced fieldworkers might need to “unlearn” undesired habits from other surveys or might feel overconfident and pay less attention during training, resulting in them sometimes being less qualified than newer recruits. Continuous assessment during training provides a solid picture of trainee’s capacity to work on this specific survey. Increases attention during training. Knowing about the competitive merit-based selection and having early and frequent tests, reinforces to trainees that it matters to pay attention, participate, and independently study material. This is often true for experienced fieldworkers who otherwise may not pay full attention, being confident that they will be hired anyway. Regular tests make it clear to trainees what they do not know. Knowing their relative score during the training also motivates low performers to increase their efforts. Higher attention and participation lead to higher learning outcomes and better performance. Tailored feedback and training. Early test results reveal content areas that are poorly understood and need more attention in training. Reviewing and debriefing written tests also provides valuable insights on where misunderstandings stem from or why mistakes are made. Trainers can tailor subsequent sessions and feedback to address these issues, improving the overall understanding level of trainees. Verification of methodology. The process of drafting and debriefing tests often reveals gaps in the questionnaire design, such as underdefined concepts or conflicting definitions, and helps verify whether explanations in the manual are useful. It is a great way to check if interviewers’ understanding is aligned with questionnaire design. Fieldworkers do better. As humans, we simply do better at work if we know that it matters. Testing and competitive selection help convey to fieldworkers that it is really important for them to do their job well. Builds a reserve of replacement fieldworkers. Trainees who did not get selected (but performed adequately) can be designated as replacements, in the event of any fieldworkers dropping out during fieldwork. Since they have undergone the full training, they can be brought up to speed relatively quickly with a refresher training, some practicing and strong supervision during their first few field days. For many surveys, fieldworkers are selected by the organization or firm implementing the survey, which might have their own requirements/procedures to follow. Be aware that these selection criteria and processes might lead to sub-optimal selection outcomes. Where possible, require desired protocols for the selection process, e.g., by explicitly detailing in the ToR the necessity to train an excess of trainees, select fieldworkers based on capability, have a transparent and objective process for doing so, etc. Make clear your own role in the audit/approval process by requiring that the firm submit their scoring process and selection results. 4.1 Written tests Regular written tests play an important part in the evaluation of trainee performance. They are a very useful means to systemically test trainees’ understanding of questionnaire content and training material and to identify general areas of weakness that need to be reinforced during the ongoing training. Conduct written tests on a regular basis throughout the training. This could be daily or every other day, whenever new theoretical content has been covered or after debriefs are held. For written tests to be fully effective, it is crucial that they are conducted from the very beginning of training. Leaving written tests to the end of training usually means it will be too late to alert low performers to increase their efforts or to adjust the training schedule to retrain content that is generally poorly understood. 4.1.1 Designing tests Written tests should probe the understanding of questionnaire and manual contents covered in the training so far (protocols, definitions, answer options), as well as the relevant general skills (calculating a percentage, converting quantities from one unit to another, etc.). If possible, tailor tests to specific discussions from the (previous) day, so that tests also probe if trainees paid attention. Repeat questions or topics from previous tests that a large share of trainees answered incorrectly. Write questions that are very clear, can be answered unambiguously and can be easily scored. Do not rely too heavily on simple multiple-choice questions – they tend to be relatively easy to guess an answer and may not reflect actual levels of understanding. Likewise, true/false questions can be answered correctly 50% of the time just by randomly selecting an answer. Instead, focus on questions that force the trainee to actively come up with an answer or require a combination of answers to be selected to be correct. Open-ended questions take longer to review; only include them if there are enough resources to systematically score them for all trainees. Don’t make the questions too obvious. Sprinkle irrelevant or misleading information into the questions and answer options. Add answer options such asDon’t have enough information, All of the above or None of the above to make the decision more difficult. Make sure wrong answer options are plausible or refer to something unrelated that trainees might have learned. Aim for 15-30 minutes per test, which provides sufficient data points while not taking up too much training time. This translates to around 10-15 difficult questions, some of them multi-select. If possible, try out the tests on trainees (and even with designers, ideally) before administering it. This helps identify ambiguous test questions and often also reveals previously unidentified gaps in the questionnaire design, such as underdefined concepts or conflicting definitions. Tip: To save valuable time during training, prepare draft test questions before training begins. They can be organized in the order you expect to cover the material, in roughly sets of 10-15. Because tests need to reflect what has actually been covered so far and should include references/details from the specific training discussions, they will need to be completed during the training period. Having drafts ready will reduce the amount of time you will need to spend finalizing tests (during an already busy training week). The below examples illustrate possible ways of phrasing effective test questions. One possibility is to describe a scenario that has been covered during training or is explained in the part of the manual that trainees should have already read, followed by an actual question from the questionnaire. Q1. The household has a daughter named Musa who is 7 months old. What do you record in question “A4. How old is Musa in completed years?” 1...........................................................................1 0...........................................................................2 0.7.........................................................................3 0.58 (7/12 months)..........................................................4 Nothing, leave empty and add a comment .....................................5 None of the above...........................................................6 Another useful way to phrase test questions is to write a list of statements that probe different components of a definition or protocol and ask trainees to select all the correct (or all the incorrect) statements. Q6. Select all statements that are correct according to our parcel definition. A parcel … is a group of plots used for the same purpose...............................1 is a continuous piece of land...............................................2 can be separated by a path, canal or other boundary &lt; 1 meter wide..........3 must not be separated by any path, canal or other boundary..................4 can be used for different purposes at the same time.........................5 must be entirely managed by one person......................................6 All of the above............................................................7 A similar method is to list items with different attributes and ask trainees to select all items that apply to a specified group or definition. For example, all individuals who should be considered as household members, all transactions that would count as sales of livestock products, all parcels that should be listed, etc. Q46. Select all of the people who worked for a wage or salary according to our definition. Sumini, helped with her neighbor’s harvest for one day, paid in crops.......1 Neni, a teacher employed by the government..................................2 Diah, sells homemade cakes by the side of the road..........................3 Anis, works in her parents’ shop (same household)...........................4 Mimin, works in a restaurant, paid per day, no written contract.............5 Anton, works as a guard, paid monthly, has a contract.......................6 Adding numbers, letters or names to the answer options makes it easier to refer to different answer options during the debrief sessions (e.g., Why do we consider Sumini to have worked for a wage or salary?. Tools: Tests for an agricultural survey conducted in Survey Solutions 4.1.2 Conducting tests There are several possible modalities for conducting the written tests: Test printed on paper. Works well if you have easy access to printing facilities during the training. Do not print tests prior to the start of training, as they will need to be updated during training to reflect specific details that were covered on the (previous) day. Projector and paper. Project questions on the big screen and read them aloud. Ask trainees to write their name at the top of a blank sheet of paper, record each question number and write their answers. This method is very flexible and useful for spontaneous tests, allowing last-minute updates to the questions. Provide trainees with pens in a designated color for scoring. Directly on CAPI. This modality works well when using a CAPI software that allows questionnaires to be built (programmed) and updated easily, such as Survey Solutions. Write the test as a questionnaire in CAPI and assign it to trainees at the beginning of the test. Ask them to complete one test on their tablet and send it back. Often you can copy questions directly from the actual CAPI questionnaire and modify them for the test. Answers are available instantly and can be marked using code (also directly inside the design program). A very useful bonus of this approach is that it provides trainees with additional practice handling CAPI files, including receiving assignments (questionnaires/tests) and submitting interviews. This option requires a solid internet connection for all trainees to sync their devices. Google forms or similar. Several tools exist online that can be used to quickly write tests, deploy them on the trainees’ devices and make the results immediately available. Most of the tools are online-based and require good internet connectivity during the test. To conduct the written tests, disperse trainees throughout the training venue, with enough space so that they cannot copy from one another nor talk to each other. For tests conducted electronically, trainees only need their tablets and can manage without desks. Walk around monitoring the class to ensure trainees do not copy or help one another. Help those that have technical issues and provide clarifications (to the entire class) if there is any general doubt about the quiz. Decide whether or not trainees can refer to the manual or their notes during the test. Usually there is benefit in allowing them to do so (for at least some of the tests), as it reinforces the manual as a reference tool and tests if trainees can work out the correct answer with the tools that they will have available in the field. Give sufficient time to trainees to complete the test, even if they have to refer to the manual a few times. Keep in mind that those who take a bit longer are not necessarily worse interviewers. You can set an exact time limit or stop the test once most trainees have submitted their test and there is no or little progress among those that have not. Tests can be held at different times of day, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of conducting it in the morning are that trainees are freshest and will have had a chance to revise training material the evening before (especially helpful if they were falling behind or absent). However, it is best to review the test shortly afterwards, before covering new material that same day. This can put pressure on marking the test. Holding the test at the end of the day makes good use of late afternoons which is when it tends to be most difficult to cover new material. It also stops trainees from disappearing during the day as the test effectively serves as an attendance call. Trainees can leave the venue upon completing their test and do not have to wait for everyone to finish. Afternoon tests mean trainers can mark them in the evening and give feedback the following morning, which is a good way to recap the key points of the previous day. Trainees who have completed their test can leave the venue and do not have to wait for everyone to finish. A disadvantage of conducting the tests in the afternoons is that trainees do not get the chance to learn and practice the material at their own pace in the evening. 4.1.3 Marking tests It is important to mark tests soon after they are done, so timely feedback can be given to trainees. A fast way to mark tests administered on paper is to collect completed test papers and redistribute them to other trainees during the feedback session. Give clear guidance on how to mark each question as you go through the test with the class (e.g., “Put a ✓ or an ✗ in a different color on the left of the question number and write the total number of ✓ in the top left corner at the end”). During the feedback sessions, ask for a show of hands of those who marked a question as correct or wrong to get an impression of how well a question was understood. At the end, collect the test papers, cross check the marking and record the score for each trainee. For tests conducted on CAPI or any other electronic tool, you can export the data and write a short script to mark the test. The script should calculate the score for each trainee and provide overall class results for each question – giving the percentage of trainees that answered it correctly, tabulating wrong answers and listing the trainees who answered it wrong. Prepare (a draft of) the script before administering the test, so you can hold the feedback session shortly afterwards. In some tools, you can specify the correct answers and do the marking directly in the tool. For example, in Survey Solutions this can be done by creating variables that calculate and display the score only in supervisor-level questions. Keep systematic record of the scores, ideally in a spreadsheet. For each test, record the total number of points possible and the score of each trainee. Do not use the average across individual test scores to calculate a total score and ranking across all tests to date, as tests tend to be of different length and difficulty. Instead, calculate the total score as the sum of individual test scores over the sum of total points possible in all tests to date. 4.1.4 Providing feedback For each test, hold a feedback session, ideally shortly after the test, but no later than the following morning. Do better than just going through the correct answers – engage trainees who had incorrect answers to learn where misunderstandings are coming from and to ensure correct answers are understood. Involve the whole class to confirm correct answers and explain them in their own words. One way to achieve this is to project the test onto the big screen and work through it question by question. For each question, ask one of the trainees who answered it incorrectly to come to the front, read the question, and answer it in front of class, explaining their reasoning and cognitive steps. The class should not help the trainee. Once they have answered the test question, ask the class if the answer was correct or wrong, the reasons why and to provide feedback. Step in if the class response is incorrect. Make sure the trainee in front understands where the error was in their thinking. Sometimes discussions arise if test questions were ambiguous or if trainees feel like they have been marked incorrectly. Do not let discussion get carried away. Intervene, repeat what is correct and why and move on. If there were any issues with the test question or how answers were interpreted, exclude the question from the overall score, tell the class and end the discussion. If a test question reveals widespread misunderstanding of the manual or questionnaire, consider revising them; not doing so would likely cause confusion again if unaddressed. 4.2 Evaluating trainee skills Understanding the questionnaire alone does not make good fieldworkers. Other trainee skills and characteristics can be equally valuable and should be taken into account for fieldworker selection. This includes trainees’ performance in interviewing techniques, ability to use CAPI, friendliness or ability to put respondents at ease, etc. These skills and characteristics are not captured in written test and must be observed during training. Sometimes this is done implicitly, in an unstructured manner. As an example, while deciding which of two trainees with similar test scores to keep, trainers might drop a trainee that they observed consistently struggling with CAPI. This, however, risks the evaluation being subjective, undermining the transparency and objectiveness of the selection process. For a comparable and comprehensive ranking of skills and characteristics, a more structured approach is needed, especially when dealing with large class sizes, multiple trainers doing the evaluating, or when evaluated skills are one of the core selection criteria. This sub-chapter provides a step-by-step guide on how to evaluate skills using a skill matrix. 4.2.1 Identify key skills To produce a comparable and comprehensive ranking, first identify a few key skills and characteristics that matter most for the survey and cannot easily be evaluated in written tests. Examples are: Any of the trained interviewing skills CAPI and tablet use Sound of voice, intonation, reading speed (especially for phone surveys) Ability to self-organize, work independently Friendliness and sociability Persuasiveness and persistence (especially if high unit non-response rate is expected) Trustworthiness and reliability (especially if working without direct supervision) Thoroughness, attention to detail Leadership and organization skills (if supervisors will also be selected from trainees) Interaction with children and mothers (for surveys with anthropometric modules or student testing) Different sets of skills and characteristics might be relevant for different roles. For example, supervisors should be evaluated as trustworthy, reliable and have organizational capabilities; data monitors need to be reliable and thorough, not mind repetitive tasks and be able to work independently. Trainees should be scored against each of the selected key skills during the training. Be realistic, prioritize and select only the skills that matter most (max 3-5) so there is an opportunity to actually evaluate and score all trainees. If there is limited time or capacity or no need to score against multiple skills, you can score trainees against a single dimension, overall interviewing skills. When coming up with a single score, trainers can evaluate various skills, noting down any outliers together with the overall score, e.g., “overall score 3, but very weak in introduction to respondent”. 4.2.2 Design a scoring system You need to use a common scoring system to evaluate skills across trainees, especially if more than one trainer is evaluating trainees. Prepare a detailed scoring system with descriptions of each score. Review it with trainers early so they can refer to it throughout training and during scoring. Table 4.1 shows an example scoring system: Table 2.1: Table 4.1: A skill scoring system. Score Rating Description 5 Excellent, exceptional mastery Can be expected to perform extremely well. Can act as role model during training and field work. 4 Very good, above average More than adequate for effective performance. Possess a high skill level. No counterproductive behavior or deficiencies. No major deficiencies. 3 Good, acceptable, average Should be adequate for performance requirements. Possess an acceptable skill level. No major counterproductive behavior or deficiencies. May require more consistent supervision. 2 Weak, less than acceptable Insufficient for performance requirements. Does not possess sufficient skill level. Some counterproductive behavior or deficiencies. 1 Poor, unacceptable Significantly below performance requirements. Does not possess the skill. Counterproductive behavior and/or many deficiencies. 4.2.3 Create a skills matrix Create a skills matrix. In its most basic form, this is a spreadsheet with trainees in rows and skills in columns. Each cell contains a trainee’s score for a skill. An illustrative example is displayed in Figure 4.1. You can download the Excel version here. Figure 4.1: Example skills matrix for trainee evaluation A comments column is useful for recording additional details on the scores or any other observations regarding a trainee. Ideally, the skills matrix also contains the results for all written tests and the overall score and rank, so you can get a quick overview of trainees’ performance across all competencies. Color coding works great to quickly provide an overview of the relative performance of individual trainees. You could also calculate an aggregate score across all skills or across skills and test results to obtain a single metric for each trainee (not done in example). Keep in mind that you might want to weigh individual components differently or exclude some components. For example, in Figure 4.1, it would not make sense to include the score for Supervising into an aggregate that scores trainees’ suitability for the interviewer role. If using an aggregate metric, always also refer to the individual components when making decisions. Fill the matrix with scores. Different options are possible, depending on your set-up: Trainers can record scores in their notes or in printouts of the matrix; at the end of the day, they can copy their scores into a shared spread sheet. This is easiest to set up but might create issues with some trainees being scored more than once and others not at all. Build the skills matrix in an online spread sheet such as Google Docs. Trainers record their scores directly on the spreadsheet. Create a short online form, such as Google Form, with questions for the trainee’s name, skill, score and a comment to explain the score if needed. Make the form available to trainers to score throughout the day. You can link the form directly to a skill matrix on Google Sheets. This takes slightly longer to set up but helps keep track of who scored whom and the reasons for the score. 4.2.4 Rate skills There is only a limited amount of time available during training to conduct a comprehensive rating of trainees’ skills. Start rating as early as possible and rate skills in all phases of training. During the theoretical part of training, trainers should engage as much as possible with trainees and score them in skills that can be evaluated in the given interaction. For example, you can score their ability to read out questions or intonation of their voice easily during the questionnaire content modules. Trainers not actively leading a module can observe some skills, such as the ability to use the CAPI software or tablets. During practice modules (on-site or in the field), assign each trainer a set of trainees to observe and score. Trainers should observe each trainee long enough to have an impression of their capabilities and to be able to score them in one or more key skills. Front-of-class interviews are also a great opportunity to score the trainee acting as interviewer. Regularly check the skills matrix for completion and target trainees that have not been evaluated yet. If you have enough time, try to ensure that each trainee is rated by more than one trainer to create a consensus decision. Give feedback to trainees. If you scored them low on a skill, explain why and that they should try to improve on it throughout the training. Be aware of changes over time as trainees (hopefully) acquired skills during the training. Scores from the beginning of the training for one trainee are not necessarily comparable to those for another at the end. Although scoring should begin early in the training, give more weight to later assessments so that scores reflect as much as possible the skill levels at the end of the training, as you are ultimately interested in trainees’ potential to perform in the field, not their learning curve throughout the training. Towards the end of the training re-evaluate extreme scores (especially bad ones) before taking decisions, to confirm if they still hold true. Also review/re-evaluate trainees that are borderline in or outside of the selection. 4.3 Standardization tests When interviewers are responsible for taking measurements such as anthropometrics or plot size, written tests and skills observation are usually insufficient to properly assess these capabilities. Often, it is advisable to select as fieldworkers only those trainees that pass a standardization test – one that requires them to measure the actual value of a subject/sample (height, weight, plot size) within an acceptable margin of error. To implement a standardization test, follow the guidelines for standardization exercises. Trainees should not be able to observe the expert conducting measurements and no feedback should be given to trainees during the test. Calculate the technical error of measurement (TEM) and set suitable cut-off values that determine if a trainee has passed or not. For example, for length/height in anthropometry, WHO/UNICEF recommend a cut-off of TEM &lt; 0.6cm for accuracy and TEM &lt; 0.8cm for precision. For trainees that fail the first standardization test, a second test can be offered after 1-2 days of additional practicing. 4.4 Fieldworker selection The selection of fieldworkers should be objective, transparent and based on capacity demonstrated during the training. Ideally, the selection process is not limited to interviewers, but is also used for supervisors, data monitors or other fieldworker roles, especially when working with new teams or new survey implementing agencies. In some cases, long-term supervisors or monitors have shown to lack key skills or have a low level of understanding of the survey content when compared to interviewers because they do not attend all of training, pay less attention or assume they already know the content. If working with pre-determined supervisors or data monitors is inevitable, ensure they are incentivized to attend, pay attention and participate in the training, and that they know they must demonstrate their understanding of the material as a condition for taking on their roles. 4.4.1 Timing It is usually best to select fieldworkers towards the end of the training, either before or after the final field test, depending on the survey context. Selection after the final field test allows more time for trainers to observe trainees and for trainees to show their strength in the field. Those who are selected as replacements will have had some field experience, making it easier to bring them up to speed if they are needed for fieldwork. On the other hand, selection just prior to the final field test can result in a more effective final field test, as trainers can focus their supervision and feedback on the actual fieldworkers, field teams can practice in their anticipated compositions and adjustments to composition can be made if necessary. In some instances, it might be necessary to dismiss some trainees prior to the final selection, e.g., if they disrupt or slow down the training. If doing so, make sure to only dismiss trainees who clearly have unacceptable skill levels or personality traits (e.g., unreliability). Be careful not to prematurely drop trainees that might improve. Many need more time or start to improve once they realize that their relative performance levels are low. Often, slower trainees can end up being among the better interviewers. If you are training specialized fieldworker roles in parallel training streams, it is advisable to only select trainees into different streams after a few days of general training, once the picture of trainees’ capabilities and personalities has emerged. For example, anthropometric measurers need to have good interpersonal skills to be able to handle young children and caretakers, but do not need to fully understand all concepts in a long household questionnaire. Enough trainees should be selected and trained in each stream to allow an independent selection process at the end of each training stream. 4.4.2 Criteria Fieldworker selection should be based on trainees’ capability to perform the role in the given survey, measured using objective criteria including overall test results, skill ratings or passing a standardization test. In some cases, other objective characteristics may be relevant – such as spoken languages or gender – to achieve the required field team composition. Do not select based on subjective criteria, such as personal liking, or criteria that are not immediately relevant, such as having a degree or previous experience as a fieldworker. How you weigh individual criteria highly depends on the project and expected training outcome and has to be decided on a survey-by-survey basis. Do not exclusively rely on the overall test scores by simply selecting the trainees with the best scores. This would select based on comprehension alone and ignores other important skills and characteristics. The selection should be comprehensible and justifiable using the applied criteria. For example, if one trainee has been selected over another one who performed better in the tests, there should be objective reasons, such as higher scores in relevant key skills. You can decide whether to make the selection and criteria public to the trainees after the selection. 4.4.3 Selection process The following selection algorithm has worked well for final fieldworker selection in some surveys. Adapt it to meet the requirements of your survey: Drop under-performers. First, discard trainees with unacceptable performance or skill levels. They should not be used as field workers unless they receive special training after the training to bring them to acceptable levels. Select all special roles among those who score highest in the required special skills. For example, select data quality control officers among those who have understood the material well, are very reliable and thorough. Select supervisors among those who have good leadership and organizational skills, but do not necessarily need to be top of the class in the test results if they are not involved in the data monitoring. Select as anthropometrics specialists those who did best in anthropometrics training. Select interviewers. Rank the remaining trainees based on test scores, skill ratings, and other criteria you might have and select from top. Often you might find that you have too few or too many trainees with adequate skill levels. Ideally you can adjust your field work model accordingly. If there are too few, use fewer or smaller teams for longer, or extend the training to bring more trainees up to qualification standards. If more trainees qualify than required, you can think of using larger or more teams for a shorter amount of time. However, be aware that larger field teams are harder to monitor. Allocate selected staff into teams. Double check the teams balance well and adjust steps 2 and 3 if not. For team allocation, keep in mind any special requirements you might have, such as gender balance, languages, etc. Try to balance the skill levels within teams by mixing top and bottom of class, so stronger trainees can support and act as a reference for weaker trainees. Make sure teams know who should learn from whom, and that they should support one another. Also be aware of personal traits and group dynamics when assigning teams. Keep a reserve. Keep a reserve of replacement trainees who have not been selected but have acceptable test results and skill levels. They can be used to replace fieldworkers that drop out during field work. Inform them that they are on a waiting list and might be called should others leave. They need a short refresher training and strong supervision during the first few days to bring them up to speed.

The key terms used in this book are defined below. Concept Definition Data collection mode The way survey data are collected. Traditionally, most surveys were conducted using PAPI, Paper Assisted Personal Interviewing, where responses were recorded on paper questionnaires and entered centrally after fieldwork. In, CAFE, Computer Assisted Field Entry, data entry happens in the field during fieldwork, usually to allow timely computer assisted data checks. In CAPI mode, interviewers record responses of a personal interview in an electronic questionnaire form on a phone or tablet. In CATI mode, Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing, interviews are conducted over the phone and responses recorded in an electronic questionnaire on a computer, tablet or phone. Data monitor The role of those conducting quality assurance checks of incoming fieldwork data. Field practice Visits to households during fieldwork training, so that trainees can practice interview techniques. Final field test Visits to households for practice interviews at the end of fieldworker training, to assess the trainees’ readiness for fieldwork, which often also serves as a final test of all survey instruments and protocols. Household Composed of one person or multiple people, a household is often defined using a combination of criteria, such as time spent in the household, the pooling of resources, and communal eating habits. Household members may be related or unrelated or a combination of both. It is important to note that the concepts of family and household, though they overlap, are not the same. Interview The act of interviewing a respondent or a completed questionnaire with responses recorded. Interview mode The way interviews are being conducted, usually in person, over the phone, or self-administered. Pilot The testing exercise conducted prior to fieldwork training to establish full functionality of survey instruments and protocols. Pilot A more extensive test (than a pre-test), which involves implementing the questionnaire in its entirety in the field with a small subset of households. Pilots are conducted to ensure that the wording of questions reliably elicits the desired information from respondents, as well as to test overall fieldwork coordination, supervision, and logistics, including the length of interviews, expected field schedule, estimated budget, and so on. Pre-test Evaluates the software (CAPI or the data entry program, if using PAPI) to ensure that survey data are entered correctly, the questionnaire flow is consistent, and data checks are complete. This can be done with a very small sample – even just a handful of households – as long as all the modules are administered. Questionnaire A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions for the purpose of gathering information from respondents. Survey A survey is the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing the responses from those questionnaires.
